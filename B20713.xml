            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot but acquit my self of what is due from all those, who having finished the employment wherewith your <hi>Serene Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> hath honoured them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning back to their Country, bring home with them the Fruit they have gleaned in their Observations on the Forms of Government; the Designs and Maxims of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48485:11"/> those Princes near whom they have resided, together with all such other things as they esteem most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be known, and noted by your Excellencies.</p>
                  <p>I shall be brief in the quantity of things I have to say, reducing them to what is most essential, that thereby they may be the more firmly imprinted in your Memories, and shall make but three Chapters of them.</p>
                  <p>In the First, I shall treat of the Nature, the Qualities, the Passions, the Inclinations, and the Designs of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII, the Kindred of his <hi>Holiness</hi> who have part in the Government, and his other Confidents, to whom he is accustomed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the most important interests of the Papacy.</p>
                  <p>In the Second, I shall speak of the College of the Cardinals, and give an account in short of the Interests, and the good and bad Qualities of each of them.</p>
                  <p>In the Third, I will declare the reasons, by which one may conclude, whether the Pope have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to love one Nation more than another; And I promise your Excellencies, the same Sincerity and the same Indifferency, which in so many years Service as I have rendred you, may have made you know is become natural to me, and without which I can undertake nothing, without putting a constraint or force upon my humor.</p>
                  <p>I should never have enter'd upon the particulars of the Behaviour, the Passions and Qualities of the present Pope, if any other had done it before me: But seeing the Lord <hi>Sagredi</hi> left <hi>Rome</hi> in the first year of this Pope's Assumption, at which time his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness professed to have Sentiments quite contrary to what appeared the years following: and that the Lord <hi>Girolamo Giustincani,</hi> who was able to have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48485:11"/> exactly observed, and sounded all these secrets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased a few months after he had begun his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and so could not therein show the heighth and sagacity of his Wit. I find my self obliged to undertake so important a Work, so much the more difficult, as being extremly nice, and very easie to be mistaken, because of the profession every one makes at <hi>Rome</hi> to keep his inclinations so conceal'd, that it should be impossible to discover them.</p>
                  <div type="part">

                        </gap>enetrate into the Interior afterwards. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII, who at present sits in the Chair, was born at <hi>Siena,</hi> the sixth day of <hi>February,</hi> in the year 1599, so that he hath passed the one and sixtieth year of his age on the same day of this present year 1660. It is now the sixth year of his being Pope, which began on the seventh day of this present month of <hi>April.</hi> This Pope does not enjoy a health which can be called perfect, because it is subject to divers such alterations, as do not ordinarily give us any hopes of a long life. The first is a great Humidity of the Brain, which obliges him to keep his head ever very Hot. Nor does this suffice to hinder the bad effects of it; since his teeth being spoiled and lost by the continual defluxion which fell upon them, he hath so few left, that if he had not supplied that want, by causing Artificial ones to be set in their stead, it would be a great hindrance to his speech: Nor does he speak plain with all this Art, and not being able therewith to chaw suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, he is necessitated to eat onely Liquid things, which have no need of being chewed; and although they should naturally be of a more easie digestion, yet experience tells us, that they do not always suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48485:12"/> with him, since he is subject to indispositions and qualms in his stomach, which can be attributed to nothing but indigestion, the debility of his natural heat hindring the concoction of such nourishing meats as they ordinarily feed him with. Exercise, however, does him good, for he walks in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and in his Garden, and sometimes a foot in those Streets that are the least frequented about the City. He finds case likewise in Purgations, for which purpose he ordains the Retreat he makes in the Campagnia of <hi>Rome,</hi> both Spring and Fall. From all which it happens, that being assaulted on the one side by the weakness of his Complexion, and upheld on the other hand by all that the Art and Industry of Man can invent, he may hold out possibly to the three and sixtieth year of his age, which will be his Climaterical, for at that time are those bad humors principally encreased and stirred up. He is not free from the pain of the Stone, which is so ordinary at <hi>Rome,</hi> being very often tormented with the difficulty of making Urine by certain little Stones, which are soonest bred in those of a delicate constitution, and who apply themselves to business. For it is certain, that none can tie themselves to it more than the Pope does, who hardly lets pass any morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving audience, employing the remainder of the day in the discussion of the most knotty affairs. And although he does sometimes divertise his more troubled and wearied thoughts by Entertainments of <hi>Literature,</hi> as of <hi>Poetry, History</hi> or <hi>Policy</hi> amongst Learned men; it is nevertheless impossible but his Spirits must then likewise be very busie and intent, in making reflexions on the choice discourses have been held before him; to which must be added such things as sometimes disquiet him; so that it is no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48485:12"/> wonder, if with all this a complexion of it self but feeble, cannot suffice to all that is necessary for the functions of his natural life.</p>
                     <p>The Pope is of a stature rather low than midling, of a black hair, which never till now beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n to turn gray, and, which is a sign of the debility of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, his skin is white, inclining a little to the Leaden colour▪ which is likewise another convincing proof of that disposition I have before noted. He loves neatness, and indeed an extraordinary decency in all things, but particularly in his diet and cloaths; and therefore the care and industry of those that cover his Table, and make ready his Viands, is so great, that they omit nothing imaginable, for the least fault, either in the Meats themselves, or the Dressing of them, were enough to anger him. But for his Cloaths, he is as curious of the best Linnen, as if he were yet in the flower of his Youth; nor does it suffice him to be cloathed in the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit Cloth, but he must have his Garments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with all the Adornments that can give them most lustre and price: as it is well known that when he goes into the Country, he wears some that are garnished with little Diamond Buttons, and other Ornaments, both Costly and Magnificent. He hath the same curiosity for the Places he dwells in, and pleaseth himself wonderfully in fair Houses, which are so contrived as to bring in the Light on every side, and where nothing more can be desired either in the Structure or the Ornament; which is the cause, that in the House whether he retires in Spring and Autumn, he was not contented with what <hi>Urban</hi> had done, but hath added new quarters to it, and changed those that were there already, that it might be magnificent and Royal. He hath
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48485:13"/> enlarged the Palace of the <hi>Quirinal</hi> with fair and long Apartments, for the use of such as belong to the Popes House, having had as little regard for the great expences required in the construction of those Edifices, as if he had Mines of Gold, or as if the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Ecclesiastical State had consisted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But the Popes pleasure is not bounded with the enlarging and embellishing onely of the Papal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, he shows the same passion for the whole City. And thus it being in his thoughts and design to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish it in the same manner, as those <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors formerly with much care and heat endeavoured to do, to wit, <hi>Augustus, Vespasian, Domitian,</hi> and others, he hath given full power to the Magistrate, who hath the office of surveying the Streets, to pull down Houses and Palaces, where he judges the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency and ornament of the City does require it. So that, in effect, one may see them very busie every day in demolishing of antient Structures, either to make some places the more spacious &amp; uniform, or to open a fitter way to some new streets, and to that purpose there is a Tax imposed on the neighbouring Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, which obliges the Proprietors to pay to those, whose Houses have been pulled down, a sum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to their value. And the Pope does so much delight herein, that as long as his time lasts, he will not abstain from making these changes, there being never want of occasion, either to remove, or to rebuild in a City, where in the time the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> possessed it, the Houses were raised without any Symmetry, onely for the convenience of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and from this arises so many complaints in the City, that without any necessity, onely for the fancy and pleasure of the Pope, and sometimes of his Ministers, many Families, that have but mean For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48485:13"/> should feel the weight of such grand Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which brings them neither benefit nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency in return. But that which exceeds all these excessive Expences, is, what he hath bestowed upon that great and vast massie <hi>Portico</hi> which he hath undertaken to raise round about the place of the <hi>Basilique Vaticane,</hi> for having changed the Design that famous Architect <hi>Michael Angel B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ola</hi> had formerly laid, who wrought with so much success at the same Temple of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> and reduced this work to one range of <hi>Porticos,</hi> which without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive expence would have made it an admirable Structure, and very commodious for the Coaches, either when it rained or shined; having changed this design, I say, he follows that of some Modern Architects, who have made it of an extraordinary greatness, for it is to be of a Circular form, with three Walks or Alleys, and all of Stone of <hi>Tivoli.</hi> And although the Architects have found by their Calculation, that the expence will not exceed five hundred thousand Crowns; yet if we reckon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the little that is finished already hath cost, we shall find, that what is proportionably to be done, cannot be completed hardly for a million of Crowns.</p>
                     <p>These high and great designs are very certain marks, that the Pope has a Soul truly Royal; and truly he makes it appear in all the publick actions he undertakes, as may be seen by the reception he made of the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in which he omitted nothing that might add any glory or lustre to make it proud and equal, if it were possible, to the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs; and by his Magnificence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oited the whole Court to shew the complaisance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48485:14"/> they take in following and imitating herein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his Holiness: But when we consider on the one side, that the Apostolique Chamber is drained by the insatiability of the preceding Popes, and on the other side, that the times are miserable and bad, the profusion of so much Treasure appears to the world to be ill husbandry and not in season, since it might have been employ'd with more praise and merit, and to better purpose, for the most pressing Necessities of <hi>Christendom,</hi> who looking upon <hi>Rome</hi> as the North-Star to guide them, and the Pope as their Tutelary God, cannot but be afflicted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, instead of healing their wounds and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing their distractions, amusing and pleasing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in raising and adorning of starely Walls. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it cannot be denied, but such great Spirits do extremely thirst after Glory and Renown. The wisest men, who perceived it from the beginning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways scoffed at the Popes sparingness in the first years of his Reign, as not being willing to see his nearest kindred, much less inrich them: nay more, it was their opinion, that he affected this little glory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his particular Interests, thereby to acquire himself a greater afterwards, as if already he had the ambition to do those things, which Popes of a most holy life could never do before: But since that the world has found the Pope extremely glad to be induced by the Cardinals and the Ministers of other Princes, to call those of his Family to <hi>Rome,</hi> while in so doing it might appear, that he was rather prompted to it by the earnest intreaties of all the Court, than by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> too subtle, and can dive too far into the designs of those that command her not to perceive this, and now rigorously soever they forbid them from judging of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48485:14"/> the actions of their Princes; yet would they not forbear it on this occasion. And to say truth, they could not apprehend how the Pope, who hath so much ambition to revive the memory of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, could suffer it to be buried in the oblivion of his kindred yet living; these were contradictions that could not in any wise be reconciled. But, however it were then, certain it is, that at present they are so well at their ease, that should the Pope die, they will have no cause to envie others riches: anon I shall give the reasons more particularly. But e're I go further, I will not omit to let you know the Original of this House, and by what degrees the Pope could rise to so high a Dignity.</p>
                     <p>His Nobility is as considerable as could be in the City of <hi>Siena,</hi> where they are registred in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those antient Families, that have been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with such Commands as that City is wont to bestow upon her Members, and have maintained themselves by their Alliance with those Families that were nothing inferior to them. But this is not the first time that they have made themselves known at <hi>Rome.</hi> In the time of <hi>Julius</hi> the Second the House of the <hi>Chigi</hi> had employments in the Court, not of Prelature, but Offices in the Chamber, which spreads the names of those that exercise them over all parts; and at that time the <hi>Chigi</hi> made theirs the more known, because they hapned to serve a Pope both passionate and turbulent above all others. Whence follows, that because of the profusion of monies those that are thus rash are forced to make use of to maintain the Wars they undertake. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Chigi,</hi> who managed the Treasury, had a fair opportunity to play his part, being naturally active.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48485:15"/> But though he were very stirring, and that there was much jealousie about the administration, yet <hi>Julius</hi> never had the least distrust of his integrity, on the contrary he testifi'd the good opinion he had of him by those marks of Honor he bestowed, in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting both him and his Heirs into the House of the <hi>Rovere,</hi> whose Arms they bear to this day.</p>
                     <p>Since that, in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> III, (as great employments are exposed to great dangers) those of the House of <hi>Chigi</hi> found themselves eclipsed a little of their first splendor, which was cause that the best of their means being alienated, and especially their delicious Garden on the <hi>Tyber,</hi> just opposite to the Palace of <hi>Farnese,</hi> which remained to the House that held the Chair, they returned to their Country, where in a moderate, but honorable condition, they quietly passed their time, till an opportunity offered it self to <hi>Fabius Chigi,</hi> who is Pope at present, and who was then a young boy of great hopes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instate himself in a better fortune, as he was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by his Parents and Friends, who believed, that a person adorned with all manner of virtues would much wrong himself, should he hide those rich Talents, and let them lie buried in idleness, by not going out from the gates of his own City. But he was hindred by the little wealth he had, and also because his friends had not been able to advance themselves during the long interval that those of his Family had been kept from the Court: Nevertheless, where power is wanting, his confidence in putting himself forward by what means soever shewed it self. For being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he got acquaintance of the Marquis <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> at that time a young man of great virtue, and for that cause ever very welcom
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48485:15"/> to <hi>Urbane.</hi> This is he, who since made himself a Jesuite, and who having been promoted to a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalship sometime since, will oblige us to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of him hereafter.</p>
                     <p>This Marquis then brought him to the Pope's feet, and presented him as a person capable to bring any business about with honour, when ever any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion profer'd to serve the Holy Chair. His manner of deportment pleased the Pope, so that how mean soever his establishment were at first, it was not long ere he was appointed to be Inquisitor at <hi>Malta,</hi> in which employment he having made his worth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, was shortly after sent in quality of Vice-Legate to <hi>Ferara.</hi> There it was, that what had been conceived of his virtue being made known, he was sent Nuncio to <hi>Collen,</hi> in a time when the divisions of Christendome were at their heighth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this employment he did not succeed so well as to conclude the Peace, yet he performed his part and devoire admirably well. But because the Protestant Forces prevailed, with whom he could have no communication, being Minister to the Pope, it was not sufficient that he had induced the Catholiques to make a fair and just accommodation, whilst the others stood stifly on their excessive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, so that he could not act as it might have been hoped he would have done, had he been to Negotiate between two Parties of the same Religion: but what is wonderful, is that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who were both tired and discontented, being brought to this pass to make the best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation they could, the first with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the others with the <hi>French,</hi> not onely without any advantage, but even to the prejudice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48485:16"/> and the Nuncio having expressed a great deal of his displeasure to both of them, he did it yet in such a manner as left no ill impression on either Party, but on the contrary they were much edified to find nothing but zeal in him, judging thereby that he was so much a better Minister to his Prince, by how much he disapproved what they had resolved to do, rather out of necessity than any good-will, onely to preserve both themselves and their Religion from greater danger.</p>
                     <p>He behaved himself with the same prudence when he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> for being called to the charge of first Secretary, though he succeeded the Cardinal <hi>Pancirolo,</hi> in whom Nature had assembled all the circumspection and craft that could be desired, and that he was to serve a Pope so difficult to be pleased, as <hi>Innocent</hi> was; yet did he carry things so well, as that Pope was fully satisfi'd in all matters that he negotiated; and above all things he shunn'd as a precipice medling with the interest of the Pope's Niece, who would have all the Ministers to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge she was both Lady and Mistris of that Prelate; and the Pope had so great a consideration for him, that being at the last extremity, where the heart speaks more then the tongue, and where all dissimulation is laid aside, he recommended him as a man very worthy to succeed him in the Papacy; so that it was not without reason that your Lordships from that time conceived for the Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> that good opinion that ever since they have had of him, and amongst those you recommended to the Lords Cardinals <hi>Bragadino, Vidman</hi> and <hi>Ottobuono,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he was the first named by those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented you in <hi>Germany,</hi> as having all those merits requisite to fill the vacant Chair: which also hath
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48485:16"/> very happily succeeded. And truly, if we consider the good conduct of his life, the integrity of his manners, and his knowledge of the Interests of all States, which are all qualities that meet in the Pope's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there is no cause you should repent your wishing it, or your having laboured to raise him: but the mischief is, that what goodness and integrity soever the Cardinals have, they no sooner begin to taste the sweetness of being Masters, and having no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior but God, but they change their natures, and think themselves no longer obliged to follow those Maxims they said were rooted in their Souls whilst they were Cardinals.</p>
                     <p>Who would believe that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> having so great a capacity, whereby he can truly judge of the dangers Christianity is in, should have assisted the <hi>Turk</hi> to advance and establish an Arsenal in <hi>Candia</hi> of all his Forces, and that he should have shewed himself every way so obstinate, as he did, in refusing those benefits which might serve in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture?</p>
                     <p>Who would ever have thought, that a Cardinal, who, before his promotion to the Cardinalship, breathed nothing but zeal, and seemed to languish with sorrow, to behold the miserable estate that Christendom was going to be plunged into by that obstinate War between two of her greatest Crowns, should not, being raised to the Holy Chair, burn with the like ardor for a general peace?</p>
                     <p>Who would have believed, that when the most essential matters were agreed upon for the healing of our present miseries, he should seek to quarrel
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48485:17"/> for very slight reasons, which have no other object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but either to amplifie his jurisdiction, or maintain his own Opinions and Sentiments? I shall hint at many of these changes in this discourse, that your most serene Lordships may consider, as they have ever done, what confidence they may put in the words and promises of these Cardinals before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Elevation to the Papacy, who because they cannot at first gainsay, what they have so lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they would do, afterwards by degrees lay aside all manner of respect during their Reign, and onely knit themselves to what their own proper interests, or the suggestions of their flatterers inspire them with. But, in the mean time, not to omit what I promised at the beginning to make known, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Pope's nearest kindred; those towards whom his Holiness bears the greatest affection, are the Lord <hi>Don Mario</hi> his Brother, who married a Gentlewoman of <hi>Siena</hi> of the House <hi>de la Cia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>a,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Flavio</hi> his Son, at this time Cardinal, and firnamed the Cardinal <hi>Padrone,</hi> that is to say, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. He hath a like, and perhaps a greater affection for the Lord <hi>Augustin,</hi> the Son of another Brother, who was named <hi>Augustin:</hi> and this was he who having two years since married the Prince <hi>Borghese</hi>'s Sister, remained Head of the Family after the death of <hi>Don Mario.</hi> I think it therefore necessary to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all these to your most Serene Lordships, since, as I have already said, the divers accidents that hapned, did not permit your Ministers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late any thing to you of certainty.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Don Mario,</hi> who is five years elder then the Pope, is beloved of his Holiness, as much as the tie and relation of kindred between them, and the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48485:17"/> respect he hath ever had for him does require, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having, however received any other favour: because the said Lord <hi>Don Mario</hi> having for the most part had but a mean fortune, could nor assist him, being young, any otherwise than by wishing he might arrive to that grandeur, and by presaging his felicity, the little wealth that came to his share be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allotted to other uses. And as he nothing at all resembles the Pope in visage, so likewise are their manners and genius very different. The one is lean, and the other is fat: the one is great, and the other little: the one is slow and mild, and the other is prompt and severe: the one is addicted to study and learning, the other never applies himself to it: the the one is of a high spirit, and ever undertaking great things, the other burns with covetousness, and pleases himself with nothing but in seeking out the means to amass much Treasure: And because the Pope hath a good opinion of his integrity, he hath given him the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the means to maintain abundance or plenty, and to content the people. But instead of that, there is nothing else heard over all the City but complaints against his Ministers or Officers, who buy and ingross before the season, to retail and sell it to advantage, and who have other Monopolies, not onely of Profits, which none till his time had ever thought on or practis'd, but likewise all those which custome had allowed under other Popes, whose nearest kindred ever manag'd them. In the present Government there is this besides, that they do what they can to improve the Offices more than ordinary, which are us'd to belong to the Pope's kindred, by such ways and subtilties as were never heretofore made trial of.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48485:18"/>
                     <p>In the Government of <hi>Borgo,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Don Mario</hi> exercising his jurisdiction, makes that of Governor of <hi>Rome</hi> to cease with a notable augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Profits of his Tribunal, he makes use of so much rigour, that every day one hears nothing but lamentations, and by his inexorableness to shew favour, he makes the present Government to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more and more odious. It hath seldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me to have had any affairs with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, because it belongs not to his Office to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any matters which the Pope treats of with other Princes, unless he have an express Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet did I not omit to wait upon him at those times we are wont to renew our complements; and I ever brought away particular assurances of the great esteem he hath for your most serene Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
                     <p>The Lady <hi>Berenice</hi> his Wife, although she were born in a City where they seldome live after the Court fashion, hath so admirably fashion'd her self to it in the short time she lived at <hi>Rome,</hi> that she is able at present to teach others: which we must not wonder at, since whatever the speaks is naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd with such a certain kind of modesty and affability, as gains the affection and attracts the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of all those that converse with her. She may be about 48 years of age. She is rarely admitted to the Pope's presence; nor does she seek very much to crave his favour, it being so enjoyned her at her first appearance in <hi>Rome,</hi> that so by her abstaining to intermeddle in things not concerning her, the Court might perceive how odious it was for the Niece of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> to delight in the management of all affairs; wherein he that suffered it was much more blameable than her self.</p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48485:18"/>
                     <p>The Cardinal <hi>Flavio Chigi,</hi> is a young man of 29 years, of a mean heighth, black hair'd, and his visage round and fat, of a constitution mixt betwixt a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnine &amp; Melanchollique. He would enjoy his health more perfectly were he but moderate in his diet, wherein he exceeds: for he eats much, &amp; very nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meats, without regarding the precepts given him for the preservation of his health. It is said likewise, that he's not so moderate as he ought to be in his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the flesh, which obliges him oftner than might be expected from his youth, to keep his bed: but the Physitians, because the Cardinal forbids them, do not tell the Pope the true reasons of his confinement, for fear his Holiness should have an ill opinion of him, and look upon him as a debauche', that loves both Wine and Women too much. I cannot affirm any thing with certainty of his ability in affairs, because if he be able to do no more than he does, I must say, that he can do but little, since one gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him but complements, fair excuses, or promises, which in the end turn to nothing, making all his answers speak either of the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he met with in his Holiness, or some other motive, that was occasion of the refusal, or delay of an Affair. And for this reason, I thought it far better in any thing of importance to go my self directly to the Pope, than to make use of the intercession of the Cardinal, who being for the most part diverted by his Pastimes, either forgets some of those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are very essential to a business, which might make the success the more easie, or elso ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesces with the first denial, or difficulty the Pope makes in it; and this brings afterwards a double trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, first to inform him quite anew, and then to take off some prejudice or misconstruction it may before
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48485:19"/> have left on his spirit. I have been forc'd to steer the same course, when I hapned to have any Petition to present, to obtain the provisions of some benefits for any such person as had deserved well, either of the State or the Embassie it self, because if I reli'd upon the promise of the Cardinal, I commonly found my self deceived. He would send me back to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Dater</hi> that Signs such Writings, assuring me, that the Pope referred himself wholly in matters of Collation of Benefices to him. So that perceiving it was pure weakness of judgment it proceeded from, or the little care he took to do me any courtesie, I never afterwards made any great account of his mediation; when I had occasion to treat of any thing that required dispatch: because this Cardinal, who is called the Master, does exercise his Mastership more in spending his time merily, and avoiding the most he can all troublesome affairs that disturb his mind, than in rendring himself considerable, as he might be, in an employment that gives him the greatest authority. This Cardinal does not show any great desire of heaping up riches, because, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, having no Nephews issued from Brothers, and finding his Branch ends in him, he little cares to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much Treasure to enrich the Descendants of his Cousin <hi>Don Augustin,</hi> on whom otherwise all the advantages that Fortune can bestow on a Man, will fall. In things indifferent this Cardinal hath ever treated me very civilly, and hath shewed me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection; and truly I believe, if he had but more courage to undergo the part he acts, by his means, one might receive greater favours of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, than those which now come from him ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily but by little and little. He shows, that he is vers'd in our History, for he relates from time to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48485:19"/> time our happy success, and he says freely, that <hi>Italy</hi> would be very unhappy, had she not had this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> for a Bulwark, which hath bounded the ambition of Strangers, and repelled the rage and incroachments of Barbarians. When I took leave of his Excellence, I could not desire greater expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his affection than those he used, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with protestations, that he would pass the bounds his Holiness had prescribed him, to give all kind of satisfaction to your Excellencies in the matters then in hand. These are his own words, <hi>It is not reasonable that the discontent for particular affairs should cause a prejudice to that which concerns the General, which is, to maintain the Grandeur of that State inseparable with the splendor of</hi> Italy.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Don Mario</hi> hath no other Son than this Cardinal, but he hath besides two Daughters, married at <hi>Siena</hi> in noble Families, that have but moderate Fortunes, proportionate to the condition of the Family of the <hi>Chigi,</hi> in the time they were married: and these are they that showed themselves not long since at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were exceeding well receiv'd and carress'd by their Father and their Mother, and the Cardinal <hi>Chigi:</hi> but they were not received with so many tokens of affection by <hi>Don Augustin,</hi> for the reasons that I shall declare: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly tell, whether they obtained a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency from the Pope to maintain them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are in, because things were carried with a great deal of circumspection in not making known what was done, for fear the Court should think that the Pope wasted the Demesns of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to put his kindreds Wives in a handsome condition; and for fear likewise of giving some cause of jealousie to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48485:20"/>
                        <hi>Don Augustin,</hi> who expecting hereafter to be Chief of the Family, could not but with trouble behold so many others, that were not of the Pope's Masculine Line, thus gratifi'd or enrich'd: It is certain how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the Lord <hi>Don Mario</hi> and his Wife, did not let them return empty handed, but gave them a share of what they had stored up, and do endeavour to encrease with so much Art and Industry.</p>
                     <p>But let us proceed to the other Branch descended, as I said, from <hi>Augustin Chigi,</hi> which consists of two Lords, <hi>Don Augustin</hi> and <hi>Sigismond.</hi> As for the first, who may be about 24 years of age, he is naturally merry, very pleasing and amiable. He never appli'd himself at all to study, but in those Exercises as befits a Gentleman. He loves to pass his time as well as any man, and cares very little to heap up any thing, because he knows there are those that do it for him: As soon as ever he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> they thought of providing a Wife for him, and cast their eyes upon the best Match in the whole Court, to wit, the Grand-daughter of the Prince <hi>Mark Antony Borghese.</hi> But they could not bring it to pass with that facility they imagin'd, because the Prince, being a man that was very wary, especially when it concerned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of his Family, scoffed at the Proposition, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he should take that Alliance for a very great honor, but first desired to see</hi> Don Augustin <hi>have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wealth and dignity, that so his Granchild might at least be able to keep a rank suitable to her quality and merits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These excuses the Prince made were not very pleasing to the Pope, who at the first word would have had him made more account of his Alliance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48485:20"/> than any other consideration whatsoever. For this cause the business hung a long while in suspence, but still with repeated applications of Love and Courtship from the Lord <hi>Don Augustin,</hi> who follow'd it with the more heat, as having the Constable <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnes</hi> for his Rival, a young man of most excellent qualities, and towards whom the Princess seemed to have a greater inclination than for himself. But the Prince <hi>Borghese</hi>'s death hapning thereupon, and the Tutelage falling to the Princess her Grand-mother, in a few days, by the mediation of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <hi>Rossano</hi> her mother, this Match was concluded, considerable for her great Dowry, which was one hundred and fourscore thousand Crowns, besides what might hereafter fall to her by succession, the House of the <hi>Borgheses</hi> having but one more Heir, a young Lord of a somewhat melanchollique consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, who nevertheless about the same time, out of divers good considerations, would needs wed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young Lady, having more regard to her Beauty and Virtue, than her Riches. <hi>Don Augustin,</hi> as well as his Holiness, thought, by the contrivance of this Match, which was celebrated with all the Pomp imaginable, that they had established the happiness of their Family on the best foundation that could be; In effect, the Lady being an extra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>dinary Beauty, and brought up under the Discipline of her Grand-mother, a very Religious person, there could be nothing more desired upon that account; and he hath already begun to taste the fruits of it, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess having given him the marks of her fertility by the birth of a young Daughter she hath brought him. This does not, however, hinder <hi>Don Augustin</hi> from diverting himself elsewhere according as his temper and fancy leads him, and his great inclination to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48485:21"/> pleasure, when it comes in his thoughts. This ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all content making him forget his first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, hath so puff'd him up with pride, that he seems to take no notice of those who passing by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him in the streets: which likewise makes him not so much beloved as his other fairer qualities deserve. Nay, it is not long since he made shew of the little respect or regard he had for persons of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for having taken some distaste at the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or fitting of the Constable <hi>Colonnes,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Cavalier <hi>de la Ciaja</hi> his Uncle to do a very disobliging act, by thrusting the Constable out of his place at a Comedy, whereat the <hi>Colonnes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended, the Pope was extreme angry, and would have it taken up by any means whatever; as it was afterwards done, but in the name of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who was but an instrument in that actions but this insulting left a great deal of discontent on the spirits of the <hi>Colonnes</hi> against <hi>Don Augustin,</hi> who was the principal author of it.</p>
                     <p>A while after his Nuptials, he purchased in the Province of the Patrimony, for seventy thousand Crowns, the Principality of <hi>Farnese,</hi> which is said to be a Fief of the Empire of four thousand Crowns Revenue. He hath also purchased a considerable Palace for his Family: but besides these, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases little, living at vast expences, but upon hopes that the Pope's long life will furnish him with ways enough to enrich and raise his Family to as brave a heighth as the greatest of the preceding Popes.</p>
                     <p>I have had divers occasions to speak with him of his Marriage and other affairs; and he hath ever given me testimony of a great esteem and particular
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48485:21"/> affection, which proceeded, as he told me, from the Pope's good-will, from whom I truly never heard any thing, but what was much in praise of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene <hi>Republique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have observed likewise, that the Princess his Wife, though she were but a Novice in the way of treating the Ministers of Princes, hath now informed her self so far, as to let them know what satisfaction she receives by the devoirs they render her, and how much she is obliged to their civility.</p>
                     <p>It remains now to speak of <hi>Don Sigismond,</hi> who arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> but a few weeks before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He is a Youth of twelve years of age, and seems to have much of his Brother's way, and, forasmuch as can be noted in him at present, is very fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd, and of so much judgment, as promises he will in time prove somewhat. As soon as ever he came, the Pope delighted to reason with him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, thereby to discover his vivacity; and was ever well satisfi'd. <hi>Don Augustine</hi> will do all he can to have him made Cardinal. But if the Pope fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his own Maxims, he should not favour him therein, having affirmed it a horrid thing to behold such Under-Branches in the Sacred Colledge. However, we may believe there is nothing but he may do, since he hath already begun to exceed all that he at first propounded to have done. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, this little Nephew hath already several Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and if the Pope survive his Infancy, it may then be easier to obtain a Cardinals Hat for him.</p>
                     <p>There are two Nephews by the Pope's Sister, who married into the Family of the <hi>Bichi;</hi> the one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48485:22"/> is he that was made Cardinal at the last promotion with the Father <hi>Sforza Pallavicino,</hi> and the other is the Prior, who having resided somewhile near your Excellencies, in quality of Receiver for the Religion of <hi>Malta,</hi> and having likewise been three times with the Squadron of the Popes Gallies at <hi>Candia,</hi> in quality of Lieutenant General, hath made himself fully acquainted to your Excellencies. As touching the first, I have no great matter to say of him, for having not been long at <hi>Rome,</hi> I could not perfectly know him: It is said, however, that he would have been a better Bishop than a Cardinal; for he hath made it appear that he can govern a Church well, which is that of <hi>Osime,</hi> where he is Prelate, but he hath not yet shown that he hath the Talent to go thorough any great affairs; nor did I trouble my self with any further information. I did reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him as I ought, when occasion profer'd to complement him, and I also took my leave of him at parting, very well satisfi'd with the manner of his reception, and the sentiments he hath for this Republique.</p>
                     <p>But as for the Prior, whom common Fame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends as a man of great merits, he never made me so happy as to know wherein that Virtue consists, since it is restrained within a perfect obedience to those that can do him good, or raise him to some degrees higher than he yet stands; for he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to make such profound reverences to the Pope's Nephews, that the lowest of their servants would not perhaps do the like. But as for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in commanding at Sea, and taking his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages either to attaque, or hotly pursue an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or in distributing the publick Treasure ordained
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48485:22"/> to that end, I shall not need to waste time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it to your Excellencies, since it was your selves informed me how little benefit had been reaped by the Popes Galleys in these parts, when commanded by this Cavalier. It is certain, that the last year there was a great deal of Treasure put into his hands, and it is as certain by the accounts that have been calculated without his knowledge, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have expended the one half. But there are none so confident as to advertize the Pope of these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors, because he having so good an opinion of him, would think it all to be onely spleene and envy that could be alledged against him: and therefore you commanded me very prudently to abstain from all complaints, for fear of withdrawing the Pope's good will and forwardness in pursuing the succour you demanded of him, which, though it were not dispiseable, became so notwithstanding, by a not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the Pope's true intentions therein. Which made me (though the Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> perceived some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of these miscarriages, to whom I might have opened my self with much freedom and assurance, and neither Pope nor Prior should have known what I said, that Cardinal having so little inclination for him) obey your Lordships most punctually in what you commanded. But the common complaints hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> been kept so close, but they came to that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's ear; he one day, perhaps to oblige me to speak, told me, <hi>That he admired that the Prior, who so much desired to gain honor and renown, bad not made some enterprize of himself, since he found it unfit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any joyntly with others:</hi> But lifting up my shoulders, I onely said, <hi>That it might be, the bad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Republique hindred such men, though very skilful in the Art of War, and valiant, from showing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48485:23"/> any marks of their great courage;</hi> The Cardinal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving he could get nothing else out of me, said smiling, <hi>That the Prior had had the good luck to be prized more than he diserved, but yet was unhappy in not being able to maintain that good opinion had been conceived of him.</hi> The two Branches of the House of the <hi>Chigi,</hi> who otherwise do not agree very well, united together to hinder his being made a Cardinal, and it seemed to them they had done much in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their ends herein, they judging the Prior to be a man of a great wit, and one who, as soon as he could have had the power to have spoken freely, would have made a division in their House; they have more acquaintance with him than my self, and by consequence may know him better. As for my own part, I never could find any eminent virtue in him, nor do I believe, he deserves to rise to any great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to which he pretends to mount by his dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling humour.</p>
                     <p>There is not among so few kindred as have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and who are in a direct line, so great concord as there ought to be, and this proceeds from a vain spirit which makes every one of them aspire to rule. The Lord <hi>D. Mario</hi> pretended, that he, as the most antient, and next to him, his Son at this time a Cardinal, ought to be head of the Family, and that by right it belonged to him to encrease their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by marriage. But the Pope, who had a greater affection for his disceased Brother, than for him that is living, was of another mind, and from hence arose the ill-will that hath still encreased amongst them. The Pope never did any good to any of <hi>D. Mario</hi>'s Family, but <hi>D. Augustin</hi> interpreted it partiality. He said, It appeared to Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> but a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48485:23"/> to have the quality of Patron, and the supreme Superintendence of the greatest affairs, unless they allowed him together with this the Authority of granting all Acts of Grace as he pleased. He added, That it was little benefit to him to be the Son of a Father, who with his purse had raised the Pope to that heighth of honor, if now, whilst he was in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, he might nor receive the profits and rewards deserved for his Father's former readiness▪ and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. What will become, said he, of the heaps or of mony <hi>D. Mario</hi> gathers up, unless to enrich the Houses of Strangers? meaning his Daughters who were married at <hi>Siena,</hi> leaving those naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished which are of the blood of the <hi>Chigi,</hi> who ought still to abound in goods and riches. To which the Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> repli'd, That the Authority and Superintendence they had given him stood him in no stead, but to trouble his brain, for which he had a very great aversion; whereas they had left to the other the enjoyment of all the delights and applause of the Court: That <hi>D. Augustin</hi> tasted more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the freedom he lived in, being disingag'd of the management of all publick affairs, than himself could meet with amidst all that power and authority they had invested him withall: And thus neither of them, because of these contentious pretences, which though but whispered, are apparent and known to all, do enjoy that entire satisfaction they might, were their minds but united, and they contented with those degrees of eminent Dignities which Fortune hath lifted them too. The Pope knows nothing of all this, they fearing very much to give him any cause of displeasure; and from this consideration his Holiness does sometimes confer favours upon the one, sometimes upon the other, thereby to keep
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48485:24"/> them from all kinde of jealousie. He permitted <hi>D. Mario</hi> to let his Daughters and their Husbands come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and would have them there attended and served as became those of his own blood. He consented that <hi>D. Augustin</hi> should send for his little Brother to abide with him; but neither of them will remain contented when their Authority ceases, which disquiets them far more than a necessary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude would do.</p>
                     <p>The Pope hath now at <hi>Siena,</hi> as I have already said, many others of his kindred, who are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered much as yet, because they are of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote degrees. They may, after the others are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inriched, hope for some good from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, if he continue long alive, he being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally much inclined to favour those of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by employments proportionate to the abilities of his fellow-Citizens: there are already some that have principal Offices at Court, who are design'd for Cardinals, and there are other places reserved for others, when an occasion presents: To which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be said, but the Pope deserves a great deal of praise, in that he forgets not to do well for his own Country, to which, next to God, we owe our selves; and in that he does not imitate the pride of such, who being once absent loose the very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, and never take the least care for any one that had a being there.</p>
                     <p>But forasmuch as the Ministry of the Pope's kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred serves onely for splendor and state, and not in any thing essential; and that in pressing and weighty affairs it is requisite he be fortifi'd with the assistance of such as have a clear insight into the management
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48485:24"/> of great Negotiations, from whom, upon occasion, prudent and solid councel may be taken. I have esteem'd it fit to joyn, to the Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He hath a great deal of judgment, and is sincere and disingag'd from all interests; He is not obstinate in his opinions; when he hath deliver'd them, he takes pleasure in having them moderated and censured; according as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Master does require; He is indifferent in his sentiments, and although it be the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that having been Nuncio in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extremely beloved of the King and Court, he might bias that way, and cherish some inclinations for the advantage of that Crown; yet it is false, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in my time there were some troubles in that Court, which might have been appeased by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of a Minister so much in credit; but the more they believed he took the <hi>Spaniards</hi> part, the more he abstained from medling with their interests. He did all he was able not to give audience, not desiring any other employment than his own charge, to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48485:25"/> which he applies himself with all the exactness possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, carrying every night to his Holiness all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs digested, and taking himself the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Letters, which relate to any interest that may be any way considerable. I can say, that he never seemed to be displeased or unwilling to hear me speak; But it is true, that I had a care never to demand audience of him, but in pressing and earnest occasions, and always had the satisfaction that could be expected from a Minister, obliged to swerve the least that possibly could be from the will of his Prince. Now this ought to be the more considered, because if the Holy Chair should happen to become vacant at this time, I esteem his hopes very well grounded, having the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Great Duke on his side, and probably too the Heads of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that would predominate in the Conclave, that is to say, <hi>Barberino,</hi> who in <hi>Urban</hi>'s time first moved the wheel of his fortune, and <hi>Chigi</hi> who cherishes him most, as being his Creature.</p>
                     <p>The second is the Cardinal <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> of whom the Popes make great esteem, as well for the reasons I pointed out before, as because of the very good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he hath of him, holding it for certain, that he would never give him any counsel, which were not good and advantagious for the Church. To tell the truth, he is a man that hath very good intentions, and knows much, but he fails in what all those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily do, that have devoted themselves to a solitary life, and who profess a different way of living from those of the world, being extremely obstinate in their opinions. I have discoursed with him on several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, even when he was a Jesuit: and although for the interest of his order, which is now received
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48485:25"/> into the favour of your most serene Republique, he seemed extremely desirous to do me some pleasure, yet I never could truly obtain any thing from him. He hath a thousand excuses to defeat one of those good offices he might do. Since he was made a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, though it were expected one might hope for somewhat more, yet I have found him standing upon his guard more than ever, pleading the pretence of some command the Pope had laid on him not to intermeddle in any affair that were not agreeable to him. In a word, I am not satisfi'd with him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he often mention the deserts of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors from this Republique, and the obligations, which those of his Order do in particular owe unto him. The Pope refers much to him in matters of <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> and confers with him, too, about those of <hi>State,</hi> but rather to know than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, because most times he looks upon things according to the rigour of the Ecclesiastical Laws. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour was not very well pleased with him, who when all the other Cardinals had been to visit his Wife, he would not, upon a pretence, that although he had changed the habit of his Order, yet he hath not changed the Rules, which prohibits them to be amongst Women but in cases of great necessity. This kind of behaviour, which is an affected singularity, renders him odious to a great many people. He did not oblige your Lordships, when he put forth his History in answer of the Book of the deceased <hi>Padre Paul</hi> of the Order of Servants, wherein speaking too freely of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister whom you have so much cherished, he gave you cause to oppose him, as you did at the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that History, of which having said something to me by way of excuse, I presently shifted the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48485:26"/> that I might not be obliged to enter upon such tetchy subjects, upon which if we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, he might have alledged many Metaphysical distinctions, which it is not my profession to answer; but had he treated of that business in a way more suitable to that subject, I am confident I should have been too hard for him, and put him at a stand.</p>
                     <p>In divers things the Pope makes use of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Corrado,</hi> a <hi>Ferrarian,</hi> and principally in those differences which Secular Princes have concerning Ecclesiastical matters, wherein his Holiness is but ill served, for that Cardinal is a pure Legist▪ that hath no knowledge in the affairs of the world, who alleages a decisive Text on any matter in question, without any regard to the decency or respect is to be had towards a State, or any moderate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation where required; for he never makes any account of this certain Maxim, <hi>Summum jus summa injuria.</hi> This man hath, and does continually give distaste to the Cardinals and other Ministers of Princes, because he keeps himself still to the rigour of the Canons, and will distribute the Benefices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own fancy, and always upon pretence that it is the Pope's will, which he turns as himself pleases under a fair appearance of Sanctity. But the disgusts he practises, and is accustomed to put upon all the world, does more hurt to himself than to any one else, for having been so unadvised as to discover his base humor, it hath drawn the hatred of all upon him: So that for the Chair there is nothing to be expected on his part. I never had but little satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from him. And indeed, since I began to know his defects, I never took the pains to do him any courtesie that might acquire his favour, those kind
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48485:26"/> of persons thinking they do in same manner sacrifice themselves, whensoever they do but in the least act against their own opinions to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                     <p>I must also bring into this number <hi>Signior Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinelli,</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> great Master of the Apostolique Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, an old Courtier, refined in the Great Duke's Court, from whence the Pope called him, and took him to his own service, knowing the noble manner of his acting. He is not a man of a very profound knowledge, but of great experience; which makes the Pope take great delight in conferring with him, who is ordinarily well satisfi'd with his advice. Amongst other qualities that makes him considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there is one that is a very particular, which is, that he is descended from <hi>Alexander</hi> III, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been forced to she, and quit his ordinary abode, made his retreat in this Republique, who received him in their bosome, and gave him their protection, which he made use of to repress the audaciousness of the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> that persecuted him. He glories more in this, than in any thing besides, and hath a particular veneration for the merits of your Serene Lordships. There is no one more certain of a Cardinal's Hat than he. It is due to him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quitted his own Country, where he was very much in favour, to go to <hi>Rome.</hi> When he hath a Cardinal's Hat, the whole Court, who already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he deserves the suprem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Signior Fagnano,</hi> of the State of <hi>Urbin,</hi> a Prelate well known at Court for his being blind, but much more for being so clear sighted in the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48485:27"/> which the Pope hath given him over the affairs of the Regulars, deserves that I should make mention of him in this Treatise, because thorow his means, I have sometimes made an end of a difficult business, which otherwise I should scarce have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This Prelate hath a great deal of affection for this Serene Republique, as having been the first that found out the invention to draw mony from the suppression of the unprofitable Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as also from the Scandalous; so is he likewise still of opinion, that since the same necessity still remains, they should make use of the same means of supply, there being possibility and reason enough to continue it. But that design having been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by certain zealous persons, upon some other pretexts which they found out; he endeavoured to seek out some other projects to assist your Serene Lordships therein. And truly he might have found out something effectual, did they as well see the dangers at <hi>Rome,</hi> as they do in these places that are so near bordering unto it. However, I did not omit to give this Prelate many thanks for his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and I believe it will be very fit that you should return him thanks likewise: I think also, that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency <hi>Sagredi,</hi> who carries several Curiosities to present to the Pope's Family, should bestow some part of them on the good man, who hath, and may yet render upon all occasions, all those good Offices which can be expected from the confidence his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness puts in his advice, and the great credit he gives him.</p>
                     <p>The Father <hi>Virgilio Spada,</hi> one of the Order of the Congregation of St. <hi>Philip Neri,</hi> and Brother to the old Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> hath some power with the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48485:27"/> Pope; and upon this perswasion I have sometimes endeavoured to get him to serve me upon occasion, but I found him armed with a thousand excuses to evade doing me any good: whereat I did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very much wonder, knowing he onely sought the advantage of his Family, being very greedy after his own interest, and more ready to put the Pope in mind of filling his own purse, than seeking any largess for others: This made me forbear to solicite him, guessing the little profit that was like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound, to make trial of other ways which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships are not unacquainted withal, although they all proved fruitless, and too weak, when it concerned his Holiness to disburse any monies, which is not kept closer in his own Coff5ers, than it is by all the Court Prelates, who think to gain credit and repute from his Holiness, by exhorting him to preserve that Metall, which above all things makes the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Principality be highly esteem'd, as if it were not rather the Dignity and Sanctity of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Priesthood that render'd the Papacy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>And since we are now upon the discourse of the Grandeur of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it will not be amiss to show what it is, because as it appears great by looking onely upon those things which makes the Courts and Dwellings of other▪ Princes considerable, yielding, in effect, neither for number of Ministers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48485:28"/> or Officers to none in Christendome, it will seem yet far greater, by having for Assessors and Counsellors seventy Kings, for they give that Title to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals in the Act of their Creations; and therefore it is that they are vested in Purple, and are served almost like Kings: and when together with this Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they have acquired a great Reputation, their Amity is sought by the most puissant Princes, who by publick or private Pensions endeavour to make them their friends, because of the privilege they have of Electing a Pope, and what by consequence must follow thereupon, the Soveraign Dignity lights upon one of themselves; and this is in short the cause of all their arrogancy, which otherwise is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to contempt enough, besides the vexation of not being able to obtain any grace, unless they be the Pope's Favourits. It may be expected that a Pope, who hath so excellent a judgment to discern how those persons ought to be qualifi'd that are fit to be aggregated in that Sacred Colledge, as Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> hath, should promote none but persons worthy of his choice: and, indeed, the Court hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath no reason to complain, since he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none but such as deserved very much, and it is hoped it will be so st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Cardinal <hi>Charls de Medices,</hi> Uncle to the Great Duke of <hi>Toscany,</hi> is the Dean of the Sacred College. He never shows himself at <hi>Rome</hi> but when the Chair is vacant, he takes more pleasure at his own home, being free both from clamour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. He leads the <hi>Spanish</hi> Faction, not without a great deal of hopes from the Great Duke, who long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for nothing more than to have a Pope that may favour him, because of the troubles and traverses the Popes put him to, who little consider him. He was not at the Court whilst I was there. But the oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humor of that Prince is not unknown to your Lordships by other means, as likewise the great joy he ever expresses at the least news of your prosperity. He is a man that speaks little, hath a good wit, and ardently desires the advantages of his Family: to serve whom he rather suffer'd a long while in the Conclave, then gave way to elect any person that might not be pleasing to the Great Duke.</p>

                        <hi>Francis Barberino,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Urban</hi> and his Domination made some escapes, being hurri'd thereto rather by the impetuosity of his nature, than out of any evil intent, perceives at present that it is in vain to trouble the world, having extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd himself by discovering the violence of his passions. He hath lost all his ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es of ever attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to sit in the Holy Chair, which his Uncle <hi>Urban</hi> held, though otherwise both for his knowledge, and the candour of his mind, he is worthy to be placed therein. Which evidently shows, that innocency of life is no sufficient motive to oblige the Cardinals to chuse a Man for Pope, it hapning very often, that together with the greatest Sanctity there may be joyned some other such defects, as were able to put
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48485:29"/> the whole world in a confusion. Nevertheless <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino</hi> hath a little recover'd his credit under <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> they having noted the inconveniencies hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that Popes manner of Government, which they also found in <hi>Urban</hi>'s time; but with more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Although his Family inclines towards the <hi>French,</hi> yet he hath ever shewed that he hath more regard for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> his humor suiting better with the Genius of that Nation. As for the affection he hath for your Serene Republique, I cannot speak so fully of it, but I shall leave somewhat untold.</p>

                        <hi>Spada de Bresighele,</hi> which is a place in <hi>Romagnia,</hi> is a man more considerable for his Virtues than his Birth, and who for this reason deserves more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause than he yet hath. But it seems they do not look upon him with so good an eye because of the prosperity of his Family, who are lately in possession of much riches, which some of the oldest amongst them have acquired by their Farms and Marriages; and which have also been since multiplied thorow the industry of this same Cardinal, and the Father <hi>Virgilio Spada</hi> his Brother, who hath not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in striving to acquire wealth, and raise his House, though he make profession of a retired life. This Cardinal hath many very good qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, which make him worthy of a higher degree▪ but that which hinders him from rising, is the envy many have against him, and the great number of Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vous he hath, which are like to be encreased by those Marriages they have of late contracted. I must add to this the little confidence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in him, who think him a very subtile man, and one that hath a great inclination towards the <hi>French.</hi> He hath a high esteem for this Republique, and hath as

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there are few in the Colledge so worthy, if we consider all his good qualities. He hath made himself the more fully known, by that constancy wherewith he hath undergone those disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the sollicitations he made to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> to lay aside all those jealousies which might make him oppose the exaltation of the Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> whom he esteemed more worthy of the Chair than any other, in a time wherein his own hopes were not desperate. He keeps the same reputation still at Court which he had formerly, and if his advanced age would let him survive the present Pope, he would ever have the same applause as formerly. He is commonly very indifferent in his affection to other Nations, seldome favouring one more than another; but I dare confidently say, that he is partial for your Republique.</p>

He makes profession of much devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I should hardly ever trust a man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his other defects, hath the reputation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knowing how to dissemble.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal <hi>Antonio Barberino</hi> is a man, who all his life time hath ever been even gentility and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity it self. He is engaged as much as can be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>France,</hi> but in such a manner however, that he does not make himself odious to other rival Nations, because he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He reaps many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless does not make him the richer, but rather the contrary, since he consumes more money for them than he receives, as well in entertaining his friends
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48485:31"/> perpetually whilst he is in <hi>France,</hi> as in advancing the interests of that Crown. And by reason of the great inclination he hath for that Country, where they live according to his humor after a very free manner, he would rather make his residence there than in any part of the world; but it is observed, that <hi>Mazarin</hi> does not look on him with a good eye, perhaps out of jealousie, because his carriage, which is so fair and pleasing, might be a disadvantage to him, while he is more than any man alive in favour with his King. He was the first who, at the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peace, manifested the good-will he hath for <hi>France,</hi> and that in such a noble and splendid manner as was thought wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To which the Suits he opposed by Law, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48485:31"/> of that State had for a long time maintained till his Fathers death, have not a little contributed, who thinking themselves most unjustly deprived of those Honours pretended to by his Family disputed it very obstinately against him, but in the end yielded up all his antient prerogatives to him, which much augmented his Revenues, and hath gained him a very great esteem. At that time when his Holiness exhorted all those that were rich, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute somewhat towards the assistance of your most Serene Republique, he was the onely Cardinal that excused himself, alleaging the dammage which the Plague had done him in his Estate: Nay, it hath been propounded to him onely by way of trial, to give out Mony at the highest Interest, as your most Serene Republique is wont to allow, but all was in vain; although he seems to glory in his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, by which profession he thinks he hath fully compleated his devoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This man imagines that he should behave himself well enough were he in command, although he show himself but of a mean ability in ordinary matters. He was born in a Republique, and the Prelateship of his Country lighting on him, he soon put them in a condition of falling out with him, yea, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing and quarreling with the Pope too, and that for very slight reasons. In the end, all these <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villeries

                        <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> though he were made a Cardinal when he thought not of it, and, as it were, by an unexpected accident, does not for all this omit any possible endeavour to mount higher: He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whose shame he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Dignity: He hath made a strict Amity with the Great Duke, and is on good terms with <hi>Barberino:</hi> in a word, he does all he can to make good, and increase his credit, which is as yet but small, because his thoughts soar too high. Some have said, that there was nothing resting but a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding with the <hi>French,</hi> but that being equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, I shall take it in the best sense, from whence one may inser, that he treats with them in such a manner as may dispose them not to be against him, if he should happen to be mention'd. He seemed to me to be passionate for you, nor shall I believe he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled much therein, having wit enough to know what your most Serene Republique hath done for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                        <hi>Harach</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> comes to <hi>Rome</hi> onely when the Chair is vacant: There are few other things can oblige him to stay there, all his interest depending on the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Imperial Court. And being a Cavalier of a very frank Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he makes it appear, that the arts and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, used ordinarily in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48485:32"/> not pleasing to him. He hath ever testifi'd a great deal of affection for your most Serene Republique, for ought that ever. I could learn from those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded me in my employment; but having never been at Court in my time, I cannot tell what judgment I should have made of him, had I been acquainted with him my self.</p>
                     <p>I cannot affirm any thing of the Cardinal <hi>Palotta</hi> of the <hi>Marcha:</hi> those reports which I have heard of him being very various: Some have told me that he hath strange fancies, which being paliated with the zeal of Reformation, cannot but cause a great deal of trouble and disorder. Others describe him to be a very honest man, of a good conscience; yet all this is the same onely diversifi'd, because the resolutions of these kind of spirits, or their whimseys rather, do still clash themselves: And therefore he was very little lookt upon in the last Conclave, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed as much as possible his desire of being Pope, yet could be not carry it so close but his Confidents discovered the extreme passion he had for it. The Pope makes no great account of him, although he have had some Legation: and there is some likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of reason for it; because those that are lifted to the dignity of Pope, can better judge of the defects of their inferiours, than such as are their equals in authority or degree. In his Legation of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> he gave some occasion of contest to your Signiory, and therefore although he spake much of her commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I should never confide in him.</p>

                        <hi>Carpegna,</hi> of the State of <hi>Urbin,</hi> had reason enough to hope in the last Conclave, because the Great Duke and <hi>Barberino</hi> did not reject him, nor are his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48485:33"/> qualities to be despised. But, in a word, when a Cardinal wants a certain credit which is given by popular approbation, he seldome ever attains to the Chair It cannot be denied, but that both probity and simplicity of manners do meet together in this Man. He understands and can do as much as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the managing of publick affairs, but as for the pressing of them on, or, if I may so say, the refining of them, he is not much applauded for being happy therein: nor during the last Conclave was there any one that could promise himself more than very mean resolutions for the publick service, under his Government: and therefore as soon as ever he was spoken of, they found that he had not a spirit great enough for so high a dignity. Nevertheless he shewed himself worthy of praise, in that whatever his hopes, and the resolutions of the Conclave were, he never seemed to trouble himself. He loves your most Serene Signiory well enough, which I have gather'd from the discourses he hath held with me, as also from the reports of such as have beard him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conversations, when mention hath been made of publick affairs.</p>

                        <hi>Filormarini</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> hath made known his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in those disputes he had with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> King's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, during the last troubles in that Kingdome. He shew'd an invincible courage upon the threats which were like to have succeeded to effects of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against him, to make him quit that Country? But he likewise shewed a very great humility towards the Catholique King, thereby to let him know, that he was disturbed wrongfully; and his plea herein carried it against all that the greatest Ministers of that Crown could oppose against him. But by how
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48485:33"/> much he hath encreased his reputation thereby, so much hath he also therein prejudic'd himself, as to the thoughts he might have had of hopes and greater dignity, thorow that obstinacy apparent in him not to change, or remit any thing of his first resolutions, how dangerous and violent soever the attempts are against him. He was a confident servant of <hi>Barberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s in the time of his prosperity, whose services have been very well rewarded. But I do not know what thanks those can promise to themselves that should help him to be made Pope, he being a man that hath a marvolous good opinion of himself, and one that believes every thing is due to his own merits. I never treated with him, he not having been at <hi>Rome</hi> in my time.</p>

He hath little or no experience in State-affairs. He is learned as a Monk, but excells not their ordinary capacity, and hath some skill in Fortifications: But with this he is very covetous: and loves his Nepveus exceedingly, who are young people of very ill behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: if he had the command, which God forbid, there would be matter enough of scandal. This was taken notice of, by him that could have assisted him, to wit, <hi>Barberino,</hi> who hating a licentious life, would never speak one word for him, though <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culano</hi> had friends to second what he should have said, and were aged enough to pretend to the Place.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48485:34"/> Nevertheless he may live very well at his ease, if he will content himself with the condition he is in possession of, which truly ought to satisfie him. He hath named himself for Candidate, which is to say, he aspires to the Chair, though amongst those of his own Fraternity, he could never have attained to be General of their Order.</p>

He was in danger being in <hi>England</hi> during those troubles, which have encreased so long as to arrive to the strange heighth of misfortune they were then in: But a more wary Minister might have withdrawn himself without forfeiting his devoir. Being at <hi>Collen</hi> in quality of a Nuncio, he could not avoid being sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of partiality towards the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and did together with them, breed some disorder in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. At <hi>Rome</hi> he did not shew himself very grateful to his Benefactor, having subjected himself to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In the Conclave he was almost the onely man that disapproved the Election of the present Pope.

Being returned afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the place of Secretary of State being given to him, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd more than ever in the ill opinion he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived against the Cardinal, being thereto induc'd, not onely by an increase of the difficulties in the Treaty on the <hi>French</hi> side, but likewise by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious speeches of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aversion for <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and who always blamed him as the onely cause of the dammage and ruine which Christendome suffer'd under.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof had procured.</hi> If some body, under the pretence of seconding the Popes Resentment at that time, had not by a discourse suitable to his humor, endeavoured powerfully to moderate his passion, it is to be feared he would have proceeded to some greater violence and anger: But he that heard the Pope's complaints made a very prudent use of them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48485:36"/> to wipe all those evil opinions of him out off his thoughts and memory. As for my own part, though at the beginning of my Embassie, I found the wound yet open, I omitted not, on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when I thought it convenient, to insinuate to his Holiness, that these times oft required, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons should in their counsel oversway Princes, and that it was an effect of great prudence to lay aside all bitterness when we treated with them, unless we would have that wound, which perhaps would heal up of it self, to become incurable by often rubbing of it: that he might have his reason likewise, which being heard, would justifie or, perhaps, expose him less to censure for such resolutions, which sometimes do not depend on his will alone, but the result and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of other Ministers, with whom his Maxims would not suffer him to disagree. And if it were otherwise, yet however, <hi>France</hi> did not enjoy so great a happiness as to desire a War, unless it were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that those who counselled it had very powerful motives to continue it, till they could find out a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way to make both a good and lasting peace. These reasons sufficed to moderate the Pope's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints a little, yet was he not so well satisfi'd, but rejecting him he said, <hi>That when ever he had a mind to obtain any thing of his King and Council, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his particular favour or interest, he knew how to obtain what ever he fanci'd, it being known to all to what a height and grandeur he had by his subtilties raised his Family, and those that had joyned their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests with him; but, when ever it was required that he should act for the good of the Publique, his power was weak and languishing; which was a very clear argument, that he saw the augmentation of his fortune depended on a continuance of the War, which afforded
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48485:37"/> him a thousand opportunities to make new friends and creatures by the distribution of Offices, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, according to his own will, upon such persons as gave him much applause, which he preferred, though it lasted but a moment, to the immortal glory he might have acquired, by delivering Christendome from so great and continual troubles, as put it in danger of being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After this, upon the first slight rumors, which were whispered of the Peace, the Pope suspected it was some new artisice of <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s to lull the world asleep, and take off his hatred against him, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to renew the War afterwards, when during the Truce he had justifi'd his pretences; but having been certainly informed that the Peace went roundly forward, and that things were brought to such a pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Family does however but begin to recover it self, at a season

                        <hi>Ludovisio,</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who was grafted into that Family by the Mother of the Prince <hi>Ludovisio,</hi> hath the reputation of an honest man, but he hath those defects to which all such kind of men are subject; for they are obstinate and indiscreet; and sometimes too they have a grain of folly. It is difficult to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48485:40"/> with him, for if in any business it come once into his mind, that there is some case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in it, it makes him so obstinate, that nothing is ever able to make him change his opinion, and that most commonly without any reason, as the Officers of the Penitentiaries themselves have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, of whom he is the Chief: Whence it follows, that although as a Soveraign Minister he might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch business, seeing he hath the power, yet one must necessarily return to the Pope, and be at a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trouble to obtain his command for the expedition of it. I dealt the least with him I possibly could, it being hard to come fairly off with such men, on the contrary, there is nothing to be gained most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from them but ill-will and discontent.</p>

It is certain, that the inclusion of this Cardinal was highly praised, he having added both Virtue and Merit to his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which good opinion he confirms by the daily proofs he gives of his good-will in all publick affairs.</p>

                        <hi>Cibo,</hi> who is one of the Lords of <hi>Malta</hi> of <hi>Carrara,</hi> hath a great reputation at Court, because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his mind, his good life, and great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the interests of Princes, in which he hath signaliz'd himself in two Legations. He is adored, if I may say so, in the Church of <hi>Jesi,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and the Pope, who otherwise would have need of men of his parts, does not call him thence, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to deprive that City of so worthy a Pastor. And were it their rule to reward Merit, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so great and good but would fall to his share, but private interest denies it him. I should readily give him my vote, were it required, knowing I should therein at the same time both satisfie my conscience, and serve my Country, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how really he loves.</p>

                        <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> was preferred before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other whom Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> desired, for some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations represented to him by <hi>Donaa Olimpia,</hi> who foreseeing the Pope could not long survive, thought it good policy to strengthen her Family by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of such noble persons as might protect her on occasion But she deceived her self, regarding one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the merits of the persons, and not considering whether she should receive all those acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and retributions which men of honor are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to return at need. He hath, however, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applause, but I cannot tell whether the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> are satisfi'd with him, since he did not seem to give them any content in the Conclave. But I am very much taken with his expressions, which ever tend to the publick good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Goudi,</hi> or as he is called at present, <hi>de Rets,</hi> hath made the world talk of him, both before and since
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48485:41"/> his promotion to be Cardinal: before, because he was as it were the Scourge, that excited troubles in all occurrences, that admitted of the least pretence to thwart the present Government: and since, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his authority being increased, he presumed his importunities against <hi>Mazarin</hi> and his Partisans would become more effectual, and that onely for his particular interest, and to make himself famous in the administration of affairs. It cannot be denied but <hi>Mazarin</hi> was in a kind of dream when he named him for that Dignity, and committed a very great error therein, not forecasting the event of it. And indeed, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> reproached him highly for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising and dealing unhandsomely with one of that Dignity, whom both himself and all <hi>France</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. But this does not make good the too bold pretences of the Ecclesiastical power, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes, it is unlawful for great Princes to restrain the exorbitancies of a Cardinal, that endeavours to trouble the peace of the Country. There were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Assemblies at <hi>Rome</hi> to consult a way, whereby, without prejudice to the Cardinal Dignity, they might allay his discontent, but it was very difficult, since those of <hi>France</hi> required security that he should breed no disturbance, and those in <hi>Rome</hi> could not resolve to do it, because the means propounded was to give away his Church at <hi>Paris</hi> to another, and keep him out of <hi>France,</hi> without leaving him desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of what was necessary for his maintenance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charles Barberino</hi> is the third Cardinal of that Family, which is rarely seen; but that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves more admiration, is that this excess of favour proceeded from a Pope, who had made it his task to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48485:42"/> eclipse, not to say destroy, that House; so evident it is, that self-interest over-sways the minds of men, making those that were the most inveterate enemies to become the most endeared friends. This recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and the alliance that was made betwixt these Families, was the work of <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> who prudently considered, that if the Pope suffer'd this enmity to continue, he would be exposed thereby to the same inconveniencies they had brought upon others. This reflexion pleased, and was seconded by a most advantagious reciprocal union. Nor was there any cause of scruple that the Pope joyned Purple to Purple in the same Family, considering the excellent qualities of this young man, who shewed an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wit and modesty to all men, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himself wholly to the noblest studies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his birth-right in favour of his younger Brother, to make himself a Church-man; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is a very good Clergy-man, who never medles with any other kind of business. He depends absolutely on the Cardinal <hi>Francis,</hi> and conforms himself wholly to his manner of life.</p>

                        <hi>Pio,</hi> a <hi>Ferrarian,</hi> is of a Family known to your most Serene Lordships for its Nobility, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of its Branches, which shall make me say the less of him. He does not enjoy his health perfectly though he be but young, and may perhaps leave his Church at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> because the air of <hi>Rome</hi> better agrees with him, where he hath acquir'd a great deal of wealth, and intends to settle himself altogether. He glories in the natural affection he hath towards your most Serene Signiory, as of a thing he much values and most highly esteems.</p>

                        <hi>Aldobrandin,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> but originary of <hi>Florence,</hi> is the onely remainder of a Papal Family, founded upon seven Great-grand-children, Nepvews of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the VIII, who were so extreme robust, that one would have judged their Line eternal, and yet this Branch is withered. To find a Cardinal of this Family, as the Princess <hi>Rossano</hi> desired, who is the sole Hegress of all that Estate, they were fain to seek out this small Courtier, who springs from the same Stock indeed, but by reason of his poverty was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected even of his own kindred. This example, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many others, should make the Pope's clearly know, as well as their kindred, that what ever care and pains they take to raise their Family, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver succeeds or continues long, God not being pleased to suffer those Grandeurs, which are founded on the Church's Patrimony, to stand as they would have it. And who ever would be pleased to look over the History of the Popes, where their Families are registred shall find this an infallible Truth: for one shall discover, that either they were quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, or such as were left remaining became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a condition below a mean Fortune: This Cardinal doth acknowledge, that all he hath came from that Princess, who was willing to show her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the blood of the <hi>Aldobrandinos,</hi> and now, by showing himself worthy, as he hath done, of the honour conferred upon him, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good opinion of every one, upon all occasions, he patiently expects the time which may prove more favourable to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vidman</hi> staid longer here than he said he would do when he went from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised with the immature death of Count <hi>David</hi> his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48485:43"/> Brother, for whom the whole Court was very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful; because those Lords, besides the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they have had to see their Family so well stored with all sorts of riches, do so win the affections of all people by their sweet converse, that there is none but are ravish'd at their prosperity. The Cardinal is also an excellent natur'd man, who, to all his other good qualities, adds a most tender love towards his Country, which is reciprocally obliged to make their acknowledgments to him upon every occasion.</p>

                        <hi>Spada</hi> of <hi>Luca,</hi> is a Prelate who was emploi'd in <hi>Urban</hi>'s time in the affairs of greatest confidence, and he held the same credit in the time of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> which is an evident testimony that he hath excellent qualities. In his Legation to <hi>Ferrara</hi> he did you all the good Offices that you could expect from that good Neighbourhood; and when your Ambassadors were received in that City in their passage to <hi>Rome,</hi> he out-did all the Ministers of the Apossolique Chair in expressions of civility; whence I draw this consequence, that he very perfectly knows your Lordships worths, and the great obligations which are due to you from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <hi>Gualtieri D'Orvicte</hi> is <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi>'s Creature, who having power to do what she would, brought this man and another that depended wholly upon her, to promotion, by casting dust in the Pope's eyes that he might not see what she did, not caring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were pleased or not, after she made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the sault. This Cardinal was not at <hi>Rome</hi> during my abode, he resides at his Church at <hi>Fremo,</hi> where he can yet, himself, hardly believe he is awake, and really in possession of what he holds. There is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48485:43"/> little good to be said of him, and that you may judge this a truth, it may suffice to tell you, it was a work of the Brain of that Woman.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Odescalco de Como</hi> hath the <hi>Lombard</hi> way of acting, which is to say, ingenious and franck, and truly he is held to be without malice. He does not profess any skill in Politiques, but wants not for judgment, and makes good use of it; in time and place convenient. I have nothing to alledge against him, since the Court finds no fault with him; when this man is mention'd they speak briefly, without making any reflection of his good or bad qualities, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof that there is more good than hurt in him, because at Court they pardon none they can except against. I believe your most Serene Signiory may conside in a person of his humor, when he makes protestation of his affection towards you, as he hath done every time I was with him.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Ottobuono</hi> for his sweet and charming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is beloved of all the Court, nor are there any but do wish him a greater dignity than he hath: and truly he hath rendred himself worthy of it by his continued labours and vigilancy: and the rather, because by his actions, accompani'd with so much civility to all the world; and his judgment in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging business of consequence, he hath made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that he deserves one should conside in him. The City of <hi>Brescia</hi> is too narrow a limit for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his Virtues: and the expences he makes would have been better employed in some Legation, or some considerable employment at Court, where, to speak truth, such weak men do reside, that either for the success in an affair, or for want of choosing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48485:44"/> the readiest and safest ways, they do even displease those whom they most favour.</p>
                     <p>But as for his exile from Court, which we may t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

All I can say to your Excellencies of this Lord, is, that the affection he bears his Native Country is the most tender and hearty that can be desired in any of your most Serene Republique's Subjects, and whatever favours you bestow, you can never place them better than on a man, who, like this same now mention'd, is wholly disposed to prefer the publique interest in all occasions before his own.</p>

                        <hi>Maldachino</hi> is very well, the Pope was very careful to make him go and take the aire of the <hi>Campagnia</hi> for a good while, whence he returned at the intreatics of the Cardinals, who took that absenting for an exile: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not much allarm'd at his change, and declaration for <hi>France.</hi> Yet must it be said in his praise, that he did very wisely, in seeking the support and gaining the favour of a great King. Nay, there is some generosity in it, because there is no appearance he was moved out of interest; since <hi>Mazarin</hi> is not a person likely to bestow any great reward upon him, whether it be out of his natural inclination to parsimony, or some fixed design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and reduce the vast expences of that Nation, drained by so long a War, or some more hidden and refined politique consideration, it being certainly a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48485:44"/> pure folly to waste the Exchequer in Pensions for the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Besides, nothing is more apparent than this, that the way to gain those people is to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them. Interest and Fear would soon reunite them, and make them look towards <hi>France</hi> for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, did they fear they were abandon'd to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power of <hi>Spain:</hi> all the humility of submission, and art of compliance would then be put in practise to make sure of, and draw the <hi>French</hi> to their side to oppose that ambitious Neighbour, who surrounding the Pope with <hi>Millan</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> may devour him when he hath the mind to it. I have visited him ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some occasions, but never much regarded his discourse, which still tended to make me believe he is very much a servant to your most Serene Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Borromeo,</hi> a <hi>Milanois,</hi> a Lord of a considerable Birth, hath ever given testimony in those employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath had, of a strict secresie, great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and sincerity, which are qualities rarely lodged together in a man that is in power or command.

                        </gap> in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnia</hi> with much praise, not giving any cause of complaint under his Government. I cannot but give a fair judgment of his Sentiments for the publique good, on which that of your most Serene Republique is necessarily depending, which he assured me of the last time I visited him.</p>

                        <hi>Imperiale,</hi> a <hi>Genoese,</hi> is a man sit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who quickly apprehends where any evil is, and hath capacity enough to apply the remedy. He hath also a free heart, which will not easily yield when he finds on which side there is more reason.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48485:45"/> Yet cannot I tell whether he would succeed well if he had the Soveraign command, because he is a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noese,</hi> and prepostess'd with the Maxims of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which pretend to attain to that in a short time, to which other Potentates could not arrive but by a succession of many ages; and this may perhaps be one of the causes will exclude him from any higher advancement. In the mean time, he makes very powerful protestations, that he will ever side with those who stand for the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is to say in good <hi>English,</hi> that he will side with your most Serene Republique.</p>

                        <hi>Astalli,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> hath acted several parts at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in a short time. He was a Prelate of a mean Fortune; since that he was made a Cardinal. He was of kindred, and supported by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi>'s Niece, who would speak all, and do all, at that time when he was made Cardinal He was in <hi>Pamfilio</hi>'s Family in quality of a Nepvew: a while after he was rejected as unworthy of that Title, exiled from <hi>Rome,</hi> and almost cast into the Precipice: but a little after the death of <hi>Innocent</hi> he somewhat recovered himself again, yet could not make them restore what they had taken. In fine, he found relief in the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Catholique King, who hath bestowed some Largess upon him, which hath set him in a pretty good posture. The History of the strange turns he hath been subject to, would be very curious, but it being too prolix, I shall pass it by; because, likewise, ere this Writing appears, no doubt but the Relations of those times will set forth the truth of it. There can be nothing more intricate than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that Family, which then governed; for on the one side, the Pope's Niece and her Confederates
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48485:45"/> were ever making some enterprize, and on the other the Cardinal <hi>Panciroli,</hi> who was then the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of State, countermined them, and either of these scoffed at that Pope before his face; because, although he had wit enough, yet he had not the judgment or way to make those stand in awe of him, who were the most obliged to him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, this Cardinal, after he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone so many different Fortunes, attained to his case and quiet, yet without any great repute or esteem, being more addicted to follow his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, than to serve the Publique; and therefore I cannot inform you what his affection is towards this Republique.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albjci,</hi> of <hi>Cenata,</hi> is a man, who finding he can raise himself no higher by the ways of eminent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is resolved to try what he can do by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies; and this it is makes him speak so freely against the corruptions of the times, which he is not satisfi'd in doing in private, but taking delight to shew his Eloquence, which is not the highest that ever was, he discourses of it in publique Oratories, and sometimes with biting expressions, which seems to aim at the Popes creatures, who are in command. This is ill resented at the Palace, but they let him go on, as if they understood him not: and yet not being free from failings himself, it is wonder'd he should be so apt to censure others. He hath rather I know not what kind of commerce with the world, than any considerable knowledge; and having been chosen by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> as a person fit for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he made him a Cardinal, having more respect to his being an enemy to <hi>Macula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Azzolino de la Marca</hi> was brought to be Cardinal by those means that prevail most at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to say, by discovering the defects of others; I shall not stand here to repeat the story of <hi>Astalli</hi>'s fall, caused partly by the reports, true or false, of this man. It is certain, there are no eminent virtues in him, and if you except but some pretty little flashes of the Pen, which he learned in the exercise of his Office of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, I see nothing extraordinary in him. He spends most part of his time in amorous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, while all he does, brings little benefit to the Publique. I never much esteemed the great care he takes to express the devotion he hath for your Signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because I know any thing pleases his mind more than thoughts of business, thinking all his time too short to recreate himself.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> who is a Lord of a high birth and a generous spirit; might have made better use of his Talents, as it is believed, in the profession of a Souldier, than of a Gown-man: not but that he hath given some good tokens, by proving himself a good Catholique, and a good Disciple in the Maxims of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but when it concerns his taking any advantage, as he pretends much, reflecting on what he is, every one withdraws, even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48485:46"/> being wont to shew their largess towards those of his quality, are yet sparing to him, not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending what service they can expect at <hi>Rome</hi> from a Prince, who hath laid aside his Armour to take up a Cardinal's little Gown: and that which makes them perhaps more distasted with him, is his leaving the Protestant Religion to become a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique without any study or learning, which are most necessary Ornaments in a Cardinal; especially a stranger, that intends to gain any credit near the Pope. Nevertheless he does not dispair but the time may come, when he may settle himself at <hi>Rome</hi> in the condition others are in there, without any need of seeking abroad for assistance, as he hath been forc'd to do when he staid there after the creation of this Pope, being still put to his shifts, by reason of the few assignations he had, insomuch that he was forc'd to be gone for fear of intangling himself. He is a Gentleman of a good judgment, who, following the candour, so natural to his Country, either blames or praises as he finds people deserve.

                        <hi>Sforza,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> hath given himself to the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi> being easily drawn to their party, not so much for the rich benefices they bestowed on him, as out of the hatred he bears against <hi>Mazarin,</hi> with whom he could never have agreed, had he remained for the <hi>French.</hi> There accrues no benefit to the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> by the gaining of this Cardinal, but onely the reputation of having a man on their side of a great birth, and a bold spirit: for he hath otherwise no great gifts, nor any considerable adherents besides the Great Duke, towards whom he shows himself very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48485:47"/> reserv'd. His genious ever inclined more towards the <hi>French</hi> than the <hi>Spanish;</hi> yet hath he moulded his humour to the <hi>Spanish</hi> service absolutely, since he found how much more certain the <hi>Spanyards</hi> assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are than the <hi>French,</hi> and more beneficial than the others could be. This Family hath ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to have a great deal of affection for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and many of them have had employments under you, which they have performed with a great deal of applause from your most Serene Republique, This Cardinal does not forget to profess oftentimes, that his affection hath the same bias.</p>
                     <p>Here ends the old College. It remains now that I should speak somewhat of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of four of which, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cardinals <hi>Chigi, Rospigliosi, Pallavicini,</hi> and <hi>Bichi,</hi> having discoursed enough in the beginning, I shall add what may be said of the other five, whom he hath made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.</p>

                        <hi>Bagni</hi> is a Cavalier, as noble as he is understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the things of Peace and War. The <hi>Spanyards</hi> were doubtful of the Defunct Cardinal his Brother, nor do I believe they put any great confidence in this, whom they know to be very intimate with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi> which they discovered by the reproaches of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who found by <hi>Bagni</hi>'s Letters in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, that it was <hi>Mazarin</hi> had dictated them, for which he was very ill treated during his Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciature in <hi>France,</hi> the Assignments belonging to that Charge being then taken away from him, as an useless Minister: But the present Pope, whilest he was Secretary to <hi>Innocent,</hi> having more wit than he to judge of the actions of a Minister, had still an
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48485:47"/> esteem for him; and the time being come to discover his mind, he declared it more by effects than verbal expressions, honouring him with the Cardinal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and admitting him amongst his Confidents, and that with reason, because his Brother and he have served the Apostolique State the space of three-score years. He is antient and unhealthful, This Honour falling to his share in a fit time to attend him to his grave.</p>

                        <hi>Paulucci</hi> of <hi>Romagnia</hi> hath attained to a great age, thorow many troubles and fatigues, which have gained him a recompence in a time, wherein he hath little other advantage but his hopes, those advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely excepted which his friends have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him: which hapned very seasonably at this time, he not being fit to perform the Functions of a Cardinal, as being blind. He was never endued with much patience, and much retarded the progress of his Fortune by often speaking publickly with too much liberty. Otherwise he is a good man, but one that is more knowing in the Canon Law, than prudent in his converse in the world.</p>

                        <hi>Elci</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> had not the Title of Nunclo before he was a Cardinal, but he was highly approved by the Pope, and besides that, of his kindred. And it was easie to discover by the tenderness of the Pope's expressions to him, before he brought him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, that he was enrolled amongst those he most loved. Your most Serene Lordships know him far better than I do, having had him there as Nuncio a long while amongst you, with such satisfaction as you may well remember. His qualities makes him worthy of the Purple and the Papal Mitre; and I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48485:48"/> believe he may come to it in time, unless the Court grow weary of the <hi>Sienans,</hi> whereof there being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready three in the Colledge, it is to be thought the number may yet increase, if the Pope live as long as he promises to himself. The thought this Cardinal hath of your most Serene Republique could not be more advantagious than they are.</p>

                        <hi>Bonvisi</hi> of <hi>Leuca,</hi> hath passed through all the Offices at Court, shewing sometimes a constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of fixing there, and otherwile an inclination to quit it, as it seemed in his long absence he had intended. In this Pope's time, his hopes renewed afresh, considering he had a respect to the merits of deserving persons: and truly he called him of his own accord, without being courted to it. He was at first Master of his Holiness Chamber, and in that Office he improved the good opinion the Pope had of him, so that he was comprised in the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion together with five other men, who had all parts necessary to attain to the Dignities of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. He hath none but good qualities, and knows how to gain the love and esteem of others, as well as to love and esteem others himself, and especially those Princes that deserve most, in which number, to my knowledge, he places your most Serene Signory.</p>

                        <hi>Farnese,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> was under <hi>Innocent</hi> for a time the fifth Evangelist. That Pope followed his opinion in all things, and esteemed and made great choice of them, as proceeding from a man very learned, prudent, and of great integrity: afterwards he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliked him, because he spake not according to his fancy, and made no more use of him, but spake of him even in a kind of a despising way. The present Pope, who judges of the merits of men perfectly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48485:48"/> well, raised him to the Office of Majordom, in which he discharged himself exceeding well, although he had a thousand other occupations, there being no Assembly held to which he was not called, if they treated of any business of importance. He helped the Family at present in command to the purchase of the Lands of <hi>Farnese,</hi> being his jurisdiction, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested the means to exclude the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who in default of this Branch was to succeed therein; in fine, having had the Hat for a reward, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Legation of <hi>Bologna</hi> to him, which he performs to the Pope's great satisfaction. He is a great Wit, and perhaps greater than were fitting for the Publique, were he Pope: but should he pretend to it, he would find opposition, and the greatest would be the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with whom he hath never kept any good correspondence for the interest of his Family; therefore the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance they have for the Duke, and because they have prejudged he hath some inclination towards <hi>France,</hi> will do all they can possibly to obstruct his being made Pope.</p>
                     <p>The time of the promotion which is to be made in consideration of the Princes approaches, and since it is already made known who shall be promoted, I leave that care to the most excellent <hi>Sagredo</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your most Serene Lordships of their condition and qualities, and shall onely add, that as for him that pertains to your Republique, who is to be made Cardinal, I would not say any thing of it to the Pope, knowing this favour lights still on those who are most agreeable to his Holiness; it being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that your Signory does herein receive an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour equal to those other Crowns without pointing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48485:49"/> out the inclusion, or the exclusion of any one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, provided you have no diffidence of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they shall promote.</p>
                     <p>I could here shut up the List of those that make up the grandeur of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but since the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath made choice of it for her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary residence, and that I hapned to communicate sometimes with her Majesty, I shall add some small matter which I have to say concerning this Princess.</p>
                     <p>At her first coming to <hi>Rome</hi> she had so little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the grandeur of your State, that she thought it strange your Ministers should be treated equally with those of the greatest Kings in Christendom: and therefore when it was told her, that my Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor intended to give her a visit, she seemed in the beginning unwilling to allow him the same Honour she granted to the Ministers of other Princes; but being informed that she mistook, she condescended to do it in the same manner as was usual at Court. She was afterwards fully acquainted with the great service this Republique did to all Christendom, in opposing singly the dreadful Forces of the common Enemy. And this made her shew more complaisance in often conversing with me; and to have the better occasions, not regarding her little power so much as following the sentiments of her generosity, she proffer'd to find out the means to raise a Regiment of Infantiy for the service of this State, and gave the charge hereof to <hi>Sentinelli</hi> her favourite. But afterwards the difficulty of getting her mony out of <hi>Sweden</hi> being encreased, the first great heat of her good-will grew cool, so that after the order she had given for the receipt of a thousand Doublons, she made no other assignment; all the rest vanishing in smoak, as well through the death of <hi>Sentinelli,</hi> who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48485:49"/> was usually there to pay the Soldiers, as the disgrace of another who till then was thought to be in favour with her Majesty. However, I omitted not to pay her my respects from time to time, in token of my acknowledgment, to which she ever corresponded by actions of great civility. But to say truth, that Princess is possessed onely with vain speculations, which are the foundation of those great undertakings she designes. And being unwilling to venture the hazard of misfortune, hoping for all she desires, so she thinks every thing that comes in her fancy is very easily brought to pass. And if the news of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s death, which I heard of in my journey homewards, proves true, her want of mony will yet be greater. Indeed, Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> voluntarily engaged himself in those great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences were made for her reception at <hi>Rome,</hi> but no man doubts but he repented him of it since, when he perceived there was not that solidity of judgment in her as had been reported; for she hath made it appear, she is a Woman like others, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as subject to defects as any other of that Sex. She hath at present begun a course of life somewhat more moderate, and therefore more durable; and if she would have really perswaded the world, that it was a knowledge of the true Religion which obliged her to quit her Crown and Kingdom, and pass into the bosome of another Church and Country, she could not have taken a wiser resolution, than to have made her retrear into some Monastery where she might have been at ease, and lead a quiet life free from trouble, and suitable to her condition, not as to the greatness, but the conveniency of it, and with a liberty to have come out again when she pleased. She did not much praise the Pope, but said, she was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48485:50"/> promised by him, that he would put her in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to live handsomly; whereas on the contrary she perceived, that his Holiness kindred had not that esteem for her they ought to have. She added many other things, which shews her to be of a querulous humour, that is, just like a Woman that cannot tell what she would have. When I took leave of her, I found her pensive enough at the news of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition of the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> which makes me believe what I heard since his death, that she hath left <hi>Rome</hi> and is gone into her Country, the better to secure the payments they were engag'd to make her. When she hath done that, if she return to make her abode in <hi>Rome,</hi> many people will be glad of it, but, very few will have any cause to be jealous.</p>
                     <p>And now, having made know the internal and external qualities of the Pope, and his Kindred, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with those that serve him, for aid and counsel in his Government both Politique and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astique, it is time to examine the internal Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Holiness towards Christian Princes, and so to conclude by examining what his thoughts are concerning the good and advantage of your most Serene Republique, upon which, having made a most serious reflection, I dare believe that I shall be but very little or not at all mistaken.</p>

                     <p>ANd to begin with him, who holds the first and highest rank, and hath most authority amongst Secular Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Emperour, we cannot say but the Pope holds very good intelligence or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with him, since at the Election of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48485:50"/> to the Imperial Crown, he did all he was able to overcome those difficulties the Electors made, who would hardly comply, unless some satisfaction were allowed them which they pretended were due to them: and his Holiness had much adoe to gain the favour as well of the Ecclesiastique as the Secular Electors, not to name the Protestants, who being on the one hand perswaded by the Sollicitations of the <hi>French,</hi> and on the other with-held by the certain knowledge, it was then the onely time to make their conditions better than they had been; for it was much impaired thorow the long continuance of that great Dignity in the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family: and therefore the Pope speaks very load of the high services he therein did to his Imperial Majesty, having just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to expect he should in retribution do any thing for him again that lies in his power: To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is evident indeed, that they take all the care imaginable to please him. Thus at the beginning of this Pope's Government, it was chiefly upon his sollicitation that the Emperour attaqued the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> by the invasion he made upon <hi>Pomerania,</hi> notwithstanding the many difficulties might have hapned, by reason of the danger of breeding new troubles in <hi>Germany</hi> upon pretence of a breach of the Peace at <hi>Munster,</hi> which the Friends and Allies of the <hi>Swede</hi> might allege: and which, is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, this was undertaken in a time when the Court was empty of mony, which is a thing that ought still to be had in readiness upon any sudden commotion. Nevertheless the Pope's perswasions prevailed upon the promise he made, that if any urgent occasion required, and they called upon him, he would remit them a good sum from <hi>Rome;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48485:51"/> they did much want it, and craved it with much earnestness, they were put off with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses to evade the promise, as it is the custome of that Court to disingage themselves, and leave those others engaged who confide too much in them. And though this were hush'd up by the Imperialists, yet it hath made them somewhat forgetful of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Pope pretended from this Court, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering besides this, that the Pope's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour for the election of <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> was not so much to hinder the choice of any other, as out of this respect the Pope had, that if the Imperial Dignity should fall on any other Prince, it were not certain whether the Authority of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would be still continued over the <hi>German</hi> Catholiques, or whether the Pope's Constitutions would be observ'd with the great reverence as now they are, under the Government of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> which hath been ever very observant in the Customs and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that Court. I therefore hold it for true and certain, that the Pope and Emperor will at present keep a fair agreement, and the more, because in the Treaty of Peace between the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> their interests were little considered, since amongst all those that were mentioned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, these were placed last of all, at which they were both displeased and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mured to themselves; yet both dislembled this discontent, which did in some manner help to tie them the more strictly to their former considence, and made the Emperour give ear more readily to the Counsels of the Pope, When the troubles in the North increased. The Pope knows, that in the Emperor's Court perhaps he hath more credit than in any other in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48485:51"/> which will make him put those designs in execution, he hath told me of more than once, which is, to put the Emperour upon a War that will prove advantagious to Christendome by an easie way, but wholly reserv'd to himself. Perhaps the present juncture of affairs may render the thing more feasible than at another season; yet when his Holiness told me his design, whatsoever reflexion I made, yet could I not apprehend either how or when it might be brought to pass. Nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would find much repugnance on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's part, having a lively spirit, and great dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to engage upon any good counsel: but if there should be much mony required to carry it on, it would be esteemed a Chymera, because the Princes of this age have an aversion to all propositions of rupture that are made, and the Emperour more than any, especially now his Coffers are drained, and part of those under his power obey not their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour very willingly, whilst others would be glad to see him fall, and every one is unwilling to disburse. The Emperour hath no other Minister at <hi>Rome</hi> but the Cardinal <hi>Colonne,</hi> who bearing ever a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Pope for the Interest of his Family, cannot do his Imperial Majesty any great service in his Negotiations, but all passes thorow the hands of the Lord <hi>Caraffe,</hi> Nuncio in the Imperial Court, who exercises that Office with as great satisfaction to either side, as he did with profit, when he resided near your most Serene Lordships.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> Nation does, perhaps, best of any apprehend the Genious of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and knows the readiest ways to withdraw themselves
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48485:52"/> out of such inconveniencies wherein other Princes do insenfibly engage themselves. They esteem and revere the Apostolique Chair in a Souvereign de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and tender all the respect that can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from a Prince truly Catholique and pious; but for all this they are very clear-sighted and wary to maintain their Prerogatives, and prevent the Ecclesiastiques, who at present endeavour to extend their power over all, from bringing any prejudice upon them. No sooner is any decree made in the Sanctury of <hi>Rome</hi> which relishes of ambition, but it is carefully examined by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who oftentimes, without any qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gives judgment against such decrees, and after lets the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> cry out against them as they please. Many times also upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion and negative of what it contains they tell the Popes their Lesson, when they go beyond their bounds in seeking to diminish the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so that they are most commonly constrained to bow, and give satisfaction. Which happens ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely, when the Popes have to do with any other Princes, how great soever they be, for out of divers respects they dare not use that liberty of speech which is natural to the <hi>French;</hi> which makes the Popes less hasty to innovate the Prerogatives of that Kingdome, knowing that by bringing in some Novelty they do not advance their business, but rather wrong themselves, at least in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation if no other way, they being still obliged either to relax, or not to see that put in execution which they had resolved upon.</p>
                     <p>I could not find that the Pope had any aversion for that Nation, as some have believed, I onely
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48485:52"/> perceived that he condemned their new form of Government, because he thought it was invented by <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the onely object of all the injuries I ever heard from his Holiness mouth. But at the same time he complained of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> he ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed some praises of the King and Queen, and somewhat in commendations of the flourishing state of that Kingdom, to whom that unhappiness was befallen, as he said, to be governed by one single Man, who, without any regard to the publick good, sought onely his own private interest; but when the first news of the Peace was spread abroad, he was a long time very pensive, and of opinion, that it was fit to take good consideration of what passed; still doubting that <hi>Mazarin,</hi> by this pleasing and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come news, had a design to lull other Princes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

For the Pope still pleads this, that although there were many other men in <hi>France</hi> of greater probity, and sitter for that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than he, yet <hi>Mazarin</hi> would put it upon an Ecclesiastique, that so because of the integrity required therein, and the inconveniencies which would follow, he might be sure to find out some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of discontent when he pleased. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships cannot believe how much heat the Pope shewed in maintaining this opinion, for although the difference were a trifle, the action not being in it self so considerable as the Church-men would have it to be, yet I have been more puzzled about it than in matters of the highest importance, having
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48485:53"/> had much ado to perswade the Pope, not to believe your most Serene Lordships took part rather with the <hi>French</hi> than him; who by your refusing to receive his Nuncio in a habit different from the ordinary garb, you shewed how little you cared the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Chair should maintain its Prerogatives, and that Authority that God alone can limit, I omitted not to shew his Holiness, most sincerely that the end and onely aim of your Lordships was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent greater discontents that might have followed, and to abstain from those kind of Novelties which in time might have been made customary. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated some of the most considing and judicious Cardinals, to mediate about it, that so small a matter might not make dissention, but that your Lordships sincerity might be looked on with a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eye. But the Pope would not be satisfi'd with reason, who continuing his first complaints, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That it was a premeditated business of</hi> Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin'<hi>s, who had not been content to trouble the whole world by blowing the coals of dissc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And I doubt whether things can stand long as they are, unless the <hi>French</hi> resolve to recall their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from hence, as I think all the world is bound to do what they can, to maintain the Peace by such common satisfactions, hoping that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after things of so small importance shall not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our greater joy and quiet. However, I think, notwithstanding this I have related, I may truly tell your most Serene Lordships, it is most likely, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48485:54"/> although the Pope and the King of <hi>France</hi> are not always absolutely satisfi'd with each other, yet they would scarce be brought to such terms as should cause a rupture: they being likely to keep and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their amity, not onely during the life of this Pope and King, but of their Successors. And there are two reasons that oblige me to believe so; the first is, that the Popes finding they cannot intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Innovations according to their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by force and rigour, into that Kingdom, to the prejudice of the privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the notable diminunion of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Jurisdiction, will forbear it, that they may not undergo the contempt of seeing their Decrees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and their Authority despised. Whence it will follow, that the Cause ceasing, those Disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are the Effects, will cease likewise. The second, which is purely Politique, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this, That although the Popes have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great power over the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> by their having several times extremely obliged them, and do in their Country exercise an Authority not at all disputed, nevertheless they cannot but have some jealousie and fear, lest that Monarchy should one day open its eyes, and endeavour to ease themselves of those great burthens the Clergy have insensibly laid on their backs; and because if that should happen, it may be the thunder of the Censures, and Temporal power of the Church, would prove insufficient to oppose that danger. The Pope's have therefore made it their Maxim to keep the Amity of the <hi>French,</hi> as a means thereby to help themselves in case there should any change or stirs happen on the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Some Cardinals have at
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48485:54"/> times entertained me with discourse on this subject, not in such plain terms, but however in such a way, that I could easily perceive that they see clearer and farther then some Princes imagine they do. When ever the <hi>French,</hi> laying aside their suspition of the Clergies covertousness, shall endeavour or desire to be at greater amity with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is no cause to fear but it would succeed, because of their conformity in Religion, and because of their own interest: who, if they should trouble the peace of <hi>Rome,</hi> would compel them to unite themselves more firmly with the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> a thing the <hi>French</hi> will endeavour to obstruct as much as possibly they can.</p>
                     <p>If we should judge of things according to the interest of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>'s inclination, we need not doubt but the <hi>Spanyards</hi> possess the affection of his Holiness more than any other. The interest of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> consists in this, that for the most part, the mony wherewith it is glutted above all the other Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> comes in greatest abundance from the States of the Catholique King, where the Ecclesiastical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal is held in Sovereign veneration, all the States of that Monarchy having their recourse thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the great profit of the Officers, who have a share in the First-fruits and many other things, according to their Quality, and their Offices. And as for the Pope's inclination, provided he otherwise have a general zeal for the good of Christendom, and the propagation of the Faith, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main stedfast in these two things, as I believe he doth, I think he may and ought to have a more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48485:55"/> particular affection for that Nation, whose Maxim it is, Not to admit of any other Religion in their Dominions but the <hi>Roman Catholique,</hi> and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the power they have to advance it: But in truth, things are not carri'd thus, for whether the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> believes that all the <hi>Spanyards</hi> do in pretence of Religion is rather out of self-interest, or whether this Court is perswaded they ought ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to rule over those that will never fall foul on her, how great soever the inconveniencies are they lie under, it is ever observ'd in all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences arising betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that after a great and long contest, the Agreement is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made to the Popes content, and the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of somewhat of the Catholique King's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; and when businesses have thus hapned to the disadvantage of that Monarchy, other Princes have also received a notable prejudice thereby: for when the Pope or his Ministers have once car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd so high a hand over the <hi>Spanyard</hi> as to make him yield, they presently make use of the opportunity to quell or confound those that would do otherwise, or at least to induce them not to refuse that, to which so great a Monarchy as <hi>Spain</hi> hath acquiesc'd. This stratagem may be effectual when they treat with inferior Princes, who are not able upon every contest they have with <hi>Rome</hi> to take Arms: but both the Pope and his Ministers decline all these ways, when they have to deal with the <hi>French,</hi> who, when the Clergy press'd them, by this example of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> to condescend to things which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to them, soon gave them an answer which stopped their mouthes: Nay my self being once earnestly sollicited to press your Lordships for a

And to this are all those Principalities reduc'd, who, not content with that subjection they owe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Universal Mother of Christians, have submitted to, and followed the Pope's desires in things indifferent: not that they do at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand several things of difficulty, but sometimes one thing and then another, and thus by little and little they gain so much as doth both diminish and limit the Temporal Power: and so when Princes shall think themselves Masters, they will find their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority so eclips'd and manacl'd, that they will be astonish'd to see another master them at their own homes.

But perhaps likewise the good
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48485:56"/> Genious of those Kingdomes will suggest such means as may prevent these inconveniencies, and (the present Age not having been happy in that Monarchy, by reason of the few virtuous Men that have been her late Souvereigns) fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages may produce more excellent ones, and compense her past disorders, by preventing those which might happen probably to her hereafter. In effect, if with attention we consider the present posture of things in the world, it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Christendome to have a Potent Prince, who in such dangers, whereinto the power of the <hi>Turks</hi> may in an instant and unprovided cast her, might suddenly make head against them without making of Leagues and expecting Foreign aid, which cannot be compessed but by length of time, and is a great retardment. And if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome had had in this present juncture of things a powerful Prince to have thus succour'd her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps your most Serene Signory had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the condition she is now in: And, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, on her security depends all what the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> possesses in <hi>Italy.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to what I said, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all those reasons he hath to make him love <hi>Spain</hi> and her King; and does often tell this to the Ministers of other Princes; but in such a manner however, as if it seemed that the benefits which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> receiveth from the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards</hi> were not so considerable, as to hinder the Pope from denying them from time to time those favours which they crave of him, as having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority not to grant all to those Children he most tenders what they shall desire, but onely that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48485:57"/> which will be for their greatest good, and highest, spiritual, advantage. His Holiness hath made complaint, for that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers have been too reserved and secret towards him, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> subsists because God hath assisted him: For otherwise, had he reli'd on those hopes the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had given him to supply him with Money, his enemies had triumph'd over him, and the total loss of that Kingdom would have been such a leading to other Provinces, as might have wrought the manifest danger of establishing a Power in those parts which would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formidable to all <hi>Europe.</hi> God be praised that we are so happy as to see every one return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own home again, his neighbouring Princes beginning to stickle in that War, as they ought to do; whereas nothing to purpose could have been expected from them, had the pressing affairs of Christendom summoned them to the defence of their own States. The Pope talks loudly of the good Offices he did for the Religion and Countries of the Catholique
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48485:58"/> Princes at that juncture. But the <hi>Polonians</hi> and <hi>Imperialists</hi> speak otherwise; they profess, that at the heighth of all the War they found no great benefit in the exhortations of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, which served for nothing else but onely to perswade their Enemies they had not so little amity for them, but that they would send them succour from <hi>Rome.</hi> And it was this noise and nothing else that made it believed, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Forces were so much greater than indeed they were. In the mean time, King <hi>Casimir,</hi> a good Souldier and good Catholique, finding at present his losses are nothing so great, as he had cause to fear they would prove, gives the Pope thanks for what he hath done, and to please him the more tells him, <hi>That the very words of his Holiness were not ineffectual for his assistance.</hi>

The present Pope, who seeks by all means and ways to add lustre and glory to that Court, which he thinks does consist much in the number of such Ministers as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side there on the behalf of other Princes, hath declared, that he should be much pleased to have an Ambassadour from that Duke, as from a Prince to whom the Church is much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd: This he made known obliquely to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> her Son, who found it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to content his Holiness herein, who would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48485:58"/> be willing likewise to add lustre to that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, were there any of them at present wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Purple, to lay the furer foundation for the posterity of the <hi>Chigi,</hi> upon which a certain Marquis, <hi>de la Mojette,</hi> a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Cavalier, presenting himself at <hi>Rome</hi> in quality of Ambassador, the Pope express'd a great deal of satisfaction thereupon.</p>
                     <p>The name of the Grand Duke of <hi>Toscany</hi> is agreeable to the whole Court, the Pope esteems him, and in the Consistory hath more than once spoken of his Highness with a great deal of honour, perhaps because being born his Subject, and the most part of his kindred being within his jurisdiction, he believes, that as well out of the respect to his birth, as from the consideration of what may happen, he ought to have all that esteem for him which he is worthy of. In which this Pope is more praise-worthy than the three Popes his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, which were <hi>Clement</hi> VIII, <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48485:59"/>
                     <p>These two Princes for some other kind of interests receive not that satisfaction which they ought to have, he that commands at <hi>Rome</hi> never failing to clash sometimes with one of them, and sometimes the other Prince, and that perhaps to shew they are treated alike, and so the one hath no more cause to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the Government than the other. But for all this they negotiate confidently, and as both have the repute of being prudent, they communicate and consult together when those two Courts have any thing of difference, which doth not a little serve to preserve and maintain their amity.</p>
                     <p>Although the <hi>Genoese,</hi> after they had been some time without a Minister at <hi>Rome,</hi> because in this Pope's time they had been, as it were, excluded from their pretences, have of late sent one thither with some hopes of being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heard for the future: yet I can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Pope will inovate any thing in their favour, for fear of causing some disturbance amongst the other Princes, who not thinking themselves inferiour, would not suffer them to enjoy greater Prerogatives than themselves. Every one said at <hi>Rome,</hi> that this Republique desiring more grandeur than she already hath, would suddenly disburse some great sum to obtain it, which might thereupon be granted, by covering the Contract they might make by some specious pretence. All this may be; but the fairest and the honestest way, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48485:59"/> would be to engage them to succour this Republique with their Squadions, provided they did not require a greater acknowledgment for this than were due.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> after the fair words they have given him, finds they do in effect deny the satisfaction due to his just desires, which tend to furnish him wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Estate of <hi>Castro</hi> again. I did not omit, having your Lordships Orders, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my self of those devoirs to which I was oblig'd, both by the justice of his cause, and your commands. But after they had turned me every way with ambiguous words, I found that somewhat more effectual was required to bring it to pass. It cannot be deni'd in truth, but they do very much wrong this Duke, for though in the Apostolique Chamber they have made an Act which adjudges this Estate forfeit, if he redeem it not within a certain prefixed time, yet this Pope, of a milder and more temperate humour than <hi>Innocent</hi> was, ought rather to follow the rules of Equity than the rigour of the Law, by considering, that this Estate is worth two thirds more than what it is engaged for, and that it could not happen in a worser time for him to do it, than since the Contract was made, all <hi>Lombardy</hi> having been in Arms, and he moreover necessitated to secure that Estate at his own charges, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were a Feof belonging to the Church, which hath been a very great expence to him.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48485:60"/> But when one treats with those of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique Chamber of any thing that concerns their interest, one can neither be heard, nor ever get any thing from them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of reason. It is is therefore the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of all Crowns, having consider'd the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

But one good word from the Pope makes them pass by any thing, and keeps them from doing or saying ought that may displease him in the least: and I perceive already, that the new Ambassadour from <hi>Spain, D. Lewis Ponze de Leon,</hi> is come with a design not to negotiate any thing but what shall please the Pope; and for this reason will permit the Duke to owe the whole obligation of this business to Strangers, who afterwards, and that with reason, shall be recompensed for it upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                     <p>This which I have said of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> may be appli'd likewise to the Duke of <hi>Mrlena,</hi> who alleges the greatest reasons in the world upon the Subject of <hi>Comacchio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

All that the Counsellors could do, who never want evasions to spin out a business, hath been to prolong this same. And it hath hapned several times, when they were brought to terms of concluding it by some fair composition, at the very nick of time when they were just ending, they have started some new exceptions to un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But it were convenient, that at this time when the flames of an universal War are extinguished, these sparks, which might perhaps bring all into a combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion again, should be put out likewise: and it were reasonable too, those Crowns should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their authority and power to make them leave of that base and vile avarice which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the whole world. But unless they go about it roundly, and speak to the purpose in express terms, laying aside all civility, it will be difficult to bring this about, the affairs of the Chamber of <hi>Rome</hi> being a Gulf that swallo vs all one hath, and whence nothing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed no more than from Hell.</p>

                        </gap>y, still accompani'd with the beauty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48485:61"/> of beholding each others prosperity; For, in truth, I cannot say but his Holiness treated with me with all kind of civility and good will; and as for those things which be judged blamable, as such actions, as having been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps misreported, he thought worthy of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; he hath ever done it with so much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and circumspection, that I fear I should erre should I think otherwise: because his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness hath ever spoken of your sage Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fair terms, having declared it was guided and administred with much Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Honesty. Yet I took notice that he every day made some steps towards the design he had to oppose your Lordship's wills; and though he never changed his tone of speech in treating with me, yet it was easie to see that he had given place to some sinister im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which abated the good opinion he was wont to have naturally for this State. His first words were upon my representing to him the great and pressing necessities your Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique underwent by the expences of the War; That your most Serene Lordships would not accept of those Propositions that might in part have eased you, as that in suspending some useless Religious Orders, which being once ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected had much diminished the Publique charge, there being yet a new way to bring about this benefit, if the Republique would but suffer the Ecclesiastique Order by little and little to repair the losses they now sustained by the alienation of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>lates, which might be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48485:62"/> done by revoking the Ordinance which forbad that Order to purchase any: upon which I shall not deseant any more, having written so much already thereof, that your most Serene Lordships have just cause to be tired: But whatever I could say, it was impossible for me to perswade him, but that this Ordinance would produce the bad effects he imagin'd. Sometimes he would take occasion to complain, that there were such disputes and practises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the chief Commanders of the Army, that it hindred the Republique from being well served, and that the moneys were not well administred, for that those that manag'd it made so much profit themselves, that it much damnifi'd the Publique, and that the same Commanders less careful of doing their duty than of making advantage, by way of Trade, of those Commodities they transported to the <hi>Levant,</hi> were the cause that the Publique, which required the entire application of her Commanders, received a great prejudice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. All which things without doubt proceeded from the Mouth or Pen of the Prior <hi>Bichi,</hi> who to hide or cloke his own defects, exposed those of others. From thence the Pope took occasion to complain, that the Republique in her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities made her address to none but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique Chair, and he for his part had no greater care than to furnish them with assistance, and that if every Prince, according to the proportion of his power, would but do as much as the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> your Republique would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48485:62"/> provided both for the Defensive and the Offensive: and hereupon he began to make a long enumeration of those Charges the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Chamber was subject to, and in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which was full of equivocations, as I sent word to your most Serene Lordships, he was larger than enough to tire any one. He said moreover, that at present the Peace was made between the two Crowns, and if they could formerly find out Treasure enough for a War whereby to ruine one another, they might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do it to assist this Republique, which was become the Frontier of all Christendom against the <hi>Turks:</hi> That your Signory ought to have a great and particular confidence in the <hi>French,</hi> seeing the partiality she had shewed for them, when she gave them all the satisfaction they desired, tacitly alluding to what I related that hapned about the Ambassador's Rochet. And thus we onely lost time in these discourses at the last Audience, with little benefit to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: but it hath now been certainly made known to me, that if the Pope hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to flow in performing that devoir, more incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon him than any other whatsoever, he will be yet flower hereafter, since he believes he hath gone farther than any other in his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of opposing the common Enemy. This is that which makes him unwilling to hear of the sending an Extraordinary Ambassador to <hi>Rome,</hi> imagining he would go with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign also of obtaining some extraordinary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com: which, to say truth, I see the Pope very
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48485:63"/> little inclined to grant, not to say, obstinately resolved to refuse it, because, indeed, there is no mony. If they think he will erect any Banques to get it for them, I do not believe it; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, his Holiness pleases himself in expending what arises from the few there are in such things wherein he takes a great delight, as in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and adorning of Churches, together with all accommodations for his Dwelling-house: and if he should dispose himself to do somewhat more than ordinary, I do not think he would use any other liberality but what costs him nought, which is an increase of the Impositions of the Clergy of this State, which is known to be already so bare, that it hath nothing left but the bones: and that is just a helping of us with our own proper goods, although it be not desired that we should say so at <hi>Rome;</hi> for they would have us believe, that whatever belongs to the Priests in what Country soever, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to them. When the time of my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approached, I found the Pope somewhat more mild. He gave thanks to God again for the Conclusion of the Peace, and testifi'd, that he had a better opinion of the affairs in the <hi>Levant</hi> for the future, alleaging the reason which I have noted, which was, that his heart told him, that your Republique would never lay down their Arms till they had defeated the <hi>Turks,</hi> and obtained some signal Victory over them. I guess, that he said this to me, onely to encourage your Lordships, that so they might refuse any kind of Treaty that might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48485:63"/> judicial to Christendom; or perhaps he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded some League to himself, either with the Imperial Court, or that of <hi>Poland:</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aver this, but I incline to believe the first rather, because the Pope would hardly find any Princes in those parts that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in his promises; nor would they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themselves in any enterprize without a sum in hand, that might assure them not to be deserted, when they were once enter'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. At my departure, after he had stood much upon my praises, wherein I had rather he would have been more sparing, provided he had shewed himself more liberal in his favours towards your most Serene Republique, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned me to remember, to represent these four things to you: The first, That you should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to suppress, or take up those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences at the Tribunal of the Inquisition at <hi>Padua,</hi> which are still in contest, to the great scandal of all those that hear of that matter: His Holiness told it me just so, without any reflexion on it. But when your Signory resolves to meddle with those interests, there must be some important reason that shall induce you thereto. This order was very unpleasing to me, because it concerns a matter nor suiting at all with my genious, and about which much noise hath been made.</p>
                     <p>The second, That the security of the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea should be more Carefully look'd after, for he complained, that there was no Trade in the port of <hi>Ancona,</hi> the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48485:64"/> Merchants not being secure in their passage with their goods, by reason of the Reprisals those Pirats of <hi>Dulcigno</hi> do make, their robberies, allarming the whole Coasts of the <hi>Marca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> He added, that if during the continuance of the War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> your Signory would suffer them to keep two Gallies in the Port of <hi>Ancona,</hi> it should be done as soon as the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron returned from the <hi>Levant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third, That it would please your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to forbear interposing their judgments in matters Ecclesiastical, as they do from time to time, which offends and infringes the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Jurisdiction, and makes them run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves imprudently into censorious inferences, not minding the disgraces hapning daily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: He pressed me much to oblige you likewise to moderate some of your Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, that your Signory would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Father Jesuits with their protection in those occurrences that may happen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the seeds of that hatred conceived against them, remaining yet in the hearts of some that do not well know them, it may be easie, but it would prove no act of generosity, said the Pope to me, to lay some ambush by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny or impostures against them, which are to be look'd upon with an indifferent eye, and being found out should be repulsed. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to observe punctually what his Holiness had commanded me, and to represent what he desired to your Lordships. You may be pleased
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48485:64"/> to see and consider wherein you can favour his Holiness, having so great judgment as cannot erre; which concluded his last Audience, adding thereto his Paternal Benediction which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon your Lordships and my self, with his best wishes, and a presage of victories and perpetual prosperities.</p>

And <hi>Rome,</hi> though she hath some, or should have many, render him obedience as to an absolute Prince that governs her by the means of several Courts of Justice.</p>
                  <p>The first is that of the Auditour of the Chamber, who purchases his place at fourscore thousand Crowns, and brings him in yearly twelve thousand Crowns; He intermedles with causes by Appeals from the Places and Cities of his Province, which is the <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the first place with those of <hi>Rome.</hi> He himself judgeth the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ones; but for the rest, and for the proceedings in Law, he refers them to the administration of two Deputies; He judgeth also in Criminal Causes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Strangers, having to that purpose a Lievetenant Criminal.</p>
                  <p>From Sentences of the Auditor of the Chamber, appeal is made to the Signature of Justice, which is a Court of Justice, whereof a Cardinal is ever Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, and out of the most considerable of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in 1661.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48485:74"/> that concern Matrimony or Benefices from all parts of the World, who acknowledge the Holy See, and who have no Indulgence or special License for to decide them before their own Judges. There is no Appeal from Sentences which the Rota hath once pronounced.</p>
                  <p>The Governour of <hi>Rome</hi> is a Judge of Criminal Causes; but for to take himself off for the most part of the care; He hath under him four Criminal Judges, from whom they Appeal to himself; yet so, nevertheless as that the first Sentences of those four Judges seem Soveraign, and that the Governour doth nothing but revew the Cause. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that they never condemn to dye, if the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal (though convicted by sufficient Witnesses) confess not his crime with his own mouth, Torture however is given him proportionable to the greatness of his Crime, and the conviction of the Witnesses, and thence is sent to do Penance.</p>
                  <p>The Governour takes notice also of Civil Causes, where the Salaries of Work-men or Servants are concern'd, and of differences which arise twixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Servants.</p>
                  <p>The Clergy-Men own for Judges the Cardinall Vicar of the Pope as Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he hath under him three Officers; The first, with Title of Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, who is alwayes a Bishop, to whose care it belongs to give Orders to govern Monastries, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, and other such like Churches, and Functions. The second is a Prelate, not a Bishop, with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Lievetenant of the Vicar; to whom the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of Juditiary Causes belong. The third is over the Crimes of the Church-men of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Title of Judge criminal of the Vicar, under whose subjection are Priests, Monks, Nuns, Courtezans
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48485:75"/> and Jews, so that, that Court is very great, for there are abundance of those People in <hi>Rome;</hi> the Churches though, and Monasteries which have Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or which have the Protection of some Cardinal, acknowledge that Titular Cardinal or Protector for their Judge, having an Indulgency to that purpose granted them.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Courts aforesaid, the <hi>Roman</hi> People have a peculiar one in the Capitol, which taketh cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of Causes amonst Citizens, and others which depend on the Senate with Authority, as well in the Civil as in the Criminal. This Court is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of one Senator, two Collaterals, and one Judge Criminal, all which do judge each apart. They meet twice a week, and that Court is called <hi>Assittamento,</hi> to which appeal is made from Sentences, which those Judges have given in private, and from the Sentences of that Court or <hi>Assittamento</hi> Appeal is made unto a Magistrate called <hi>Capl'itano d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The People also in the same Capitol have their Conservators, appointed formerly, for to have care of the good Government of the City; But it hath been taken from them in great part, for since the erecting of Clarks of the Chamber, who create a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves the Prefect of the <hi>Annona</hi> or of the Coin, and such like Offices which in former times were all in the hands of the People, ther's nothing left them, but onely to provide that the Bakers, Butchers, and Fishmongers, and Fruiterers have their measures just.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Rome</hi> is divided into fourteen Wards

                  <p>The Conservators are three, who have a fourth Associate, in equall power with them, who is the Principal of the Caporioni, elected amongst them with great Ceremony's, and as they are ever mindfull of Grandeurs past, they subscribe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves still Consuls, as if they were subrogated unto the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>They have a very fair Palace in the Capitole, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Statues, and very Beautiful Pictures, where they assemble themselves, once or twice a week for to give audience, and on those dayes they eat together, making a sumptuous Banquet, where they envite their Friends, and are serv'd by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Magistrate, Cup-bearer, Esquires, Stewards, Cooks, Footmen and Others. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy five or six good Towns with great Revenues, which they consume in that expence.</p>
                  <p>Under the Palace of the Conservators, every kind of Trade hath a Consul; where account is given of what is transacted by each.</p>

                     <p>The Chief of the Family of the <hi>Ursini</hi>'s is the Duke of <hi>Bracciano,</hi> formerly known by the name of the Duke of <hi>Santo Semini;</hi> for he was so stil'd before the Death of <hi>Don Paule Giordano</hi> his eldest Brother, not long since deceased without Children Legitimate. He is Father of the Cardinal <hi>Ursini,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Meruli;</hi> who is married to a Lady somewhat in years, by whom he hath not, nor never will have children; And of <hi>Don Lelio,</hi> who is unmarried: He possesseth eighteen or twenty good Towns, which bring him in well near an hundred and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crowns of Revenue, but the excessive liberality of his said eldest Brother <hi>Don Paolo Giardano,</hi> and of <hi>Don Virginio</hi> his Father, and of his Grand-father also, <hi>Don Paolo Giordano,</hi> have left him very many Debts to pay, instead of ready money, whereby to make himself greater. The Dukes of <hi>Petigliano,</hi> and of <hi>Monte Rotondo</hi> did make up two other Branches, but they are extinct not long since. The Duke of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is of them also, there he possesseth forty thousand crowns yearly Revenue, and hath Children as well as the Duke of <hi>Amatrice,</hi> who is of the same Family of the <hi>Ursini</hi>'s, and is Prisoner in the Castle <hi>Santo Angelo,</hi> for having kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48485:77"/> his Wife the Sister of Cardinal <hi>Caffarelli;</hi> It seemeth that the Name <hi>Ursino</hi> of that Family is corrupted of <hi>Rosino,</hi> for they bare a Rose in their Armes, and likewise in <hi>Germany</hi> they call him of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> which signifies a Mount of Rome. They hear about their Scutcheon two Bears which support it, which is not seen in those of <hi>Germany,</hi> an evident Argument of Equivocation of <hi>Rosino</hi> in <hi>Ursino.</hi>

                     <p>This House of the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s is divided into several Branches, whereof the first is that of the Dukes of <hi>Paliano</hi> who are also Princes of <hi>Marino,</hi> and of many other Towns, as well in the <hi>State Ecclesiastick,</hi> as in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> The Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> is the eldest; He possesseth above a hundred thousand Crowns Revenue, as well in Lands, as in Church-Livings, which have been conferr'd upon him by <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> by reason of the Alliance which <hi>Don Tad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The second is <hi>Monsignor Colonna,</hi> who had borne Armes in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders</hi> under the Name of Duke of <hi>Marsi,</hi> and after many Exployts, at length turn'd Monk of the order of St. <hi>Bennets,</hi> whence to with draw him, because he proved trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to all the rest of the Monks; he was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in <hi>Partibus.</hi> The third is <hi>Don Mare Antonio Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi> formerly Married unto a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> of whom he had two male children, <hi>Don Lorenzo,</hi> ready for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and <hi>Don Filippo</hi> designed for the Church, and five Daughters, whereof the Eldest is Married unto Duke <hi>Spinola</hi> of <hi>Genova,</hi> and the other four are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nunns or design'd to be so. He stiles himself Duke of <hi>Paliano,</hi> Prince of <hi>Marino</hi> count of <hi>Taglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cozzho,</hi> and High Constable of the Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Branch, which formerly was the first, is that of the Dukes of <hi>Cartoniano,</hi> the Father of him who is yet living, was Prince of <hi>Palistrina,</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48485:78"/> which he sold unto the <hi>Barbarins,</hi> to the end that he might live plentifully. They possesse still well near five and thirty thousand crowns Revenue, and they save as much as they can. His Eldest Son, who is a Church-man, hath bought an Office of Clark of the Chamber; The second is called Duke of <hi>Bassanello:</hi> There is a Third, who hath no Title.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Gallicano</hi> makes the third Branch, but he hath no children, and small hopes of having any, and having almost all his Estate in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Sequestred it by reason of the treacherous correspondence which he held with them during the Troubles of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us come to the Family of the <hi>Conti</hi>'s; it is possible the most Antient of all, or at least formerly it was the most powerful; <hi>Platina,</hi> relating that the Counts of <hi>Tuscoli</hi> or <hi>Frascati</hi> (in <hi>Italian Li Conti Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culani)</hi> did cause frequently Popes to be created to their Interest, by reason of their Power. Its belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the <hi>Conti</hi>'s this day living, are the same with the Counts of <hi>Tuscoli</hi> or <hi>Conti Tusculani.</hi> A certain person and very Intelligent, saith, that there is some kind of flaw in the Family; be it as it will, it is now Reduc'd to two Branches, the Dukes of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineto</hi> and of <hi>Poli,</hi> and neither of them have any great Estate.</p>
                     <p>The Family of the <hi>Savilli</hi>'s is Esteem'd by some in <hi>Rome</hi> more Antient than that of the <hi>Collonna's,</hi> and the <hi>Ursini's;</hi> there are some who will have it to be Descended from that <hi>Sabellus,</hi> of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks, but I hold that for a Fable, though in another respect it is held very Antient, and it is realy so, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in severall Inscriptions, and Antient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are obvious to be Read in Churches, and other Publique Places.</p>

The <hi>Sardi</hi> relate strange things, extracted out of the Records of their Kingdome concerning that Family, whence there have issu'd several Popes.</p>
                     <p>The chief of this Family is the Prince of <hi>Albano,</hi> and Duke of the <hi>Riceja,</hi> the Eldest is a Clergy-Man, the Younger Brother who bears the Name of a Prince, hath been Married to a Sister of the Dutches of <hi>Ceri;</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Aldobrandini</hi> who died in child-bed, of a child which is still living; The deceased Cardinal <hi>Montalto</hi> their Uncle of the Mother-side, hath left them an ample Patrimony, which hath very well restor'd them, and had not that been, it was reported that if they had sould the best part of their Estate they would hardly have been able to pay their Debts. They have an Uncle who is Cardinal, and who was Arch Bishop of <hi>Salerno,</hi> but he hath resign'd that Church unto <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I have observed that the <hi>Savelli,</hi> and the <hi>Conti</hi> expose the Pictures of the Popes of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whereas among the <hi>Ursini</hi>'s we see not that of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third, nor among the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, any but that of <hi>Mart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> It may possibly be, because that the <hi>Ursini</hi>'s, and the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s cannot reckon up so many Popes as others or because they would show that their Greatness derives not from Popes.</p>
                     <p>To these four Families, the People add four others which succeed them in greatness, among which the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48485:79"/> first is the <hi>Gaetana</hi> which derives the Origen of it's Nobility from <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> near upon the Year 1300. It hath had in less than within these forty Years four Cardinals, and several others before; It possesseth many good Towns in the Campania of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Title of Duke of <hi>Sermoneta</hi> for the chief of the Family, and the Principality of <hi>Caserta</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> There are three more Gentlemen of this Family, who have no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Estate, nor are they Titled at all. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> was a Doctor at Law, he came out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and staid first at <hi>Gaeta,</hi> and from thence he went to <hi>Anagni,</hi> where at that time the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was kept, and where he became a good Advocate; There was it that <hi>John</hi> his Son was born, who was afterwards <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and because he came from <hi>Gaeta,</hi> he was called <hi>Gaetano.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Family of these four seconds, is that of the <hi>Cesarini,</hi> called formerly <hi>Montavano,</hi> which hath drawn that Name, according to the common opinion, from the place called S. <hi>Cesario</hi> near <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> there have Issu'd out from it five Cardinals, within the space of an hundred and fourscore Years; The first of which was called the Cardinal of S. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacchio</hi> who was slain in a Battel against the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Year 1562. This Family possesseth a Good and Rich Town in the <hi>Marca</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> with a Title of a Dukedome, by Name, <hi>Civita Nova,</hi> and three more in the <hi>Latium</hi> or <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48485:80"/> which it bears still to this day. There have been many Cardinals of this Family, all very devout, as it appears by their Magnificent Churches which they have caused to be Built. This Family is at this day devided into three Branches, whereof the chief is the Duke of <hi>Acqasparta,</hi> who of late is become Heir of that of <hi>Ceri</hi> his Brother, who deceased without Issue.</p>

                     <p>The fourth of the four second Families, is that of <hi>Altemps</hi> lately come out of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bear the Title of Counts of <hi>Altempts</hi> in <hi>Suaube,</hi> by the means that one of those Counts having es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poused the Sister of <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> he had a Son a Cardinal, who was very Rich, but very Dissolute, Solasing himself with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady, with whom he got a certain Disease which did not hinder him, though from getting a Son, who because of his Riches Married with a Lady of the Family of the <hi>Ursini's;</hi> whence issu'd <hi>Giovanai Angelo</hi> Father of the present Duke, who is far wiser than his Father, or his Grand-father either, who were banisht a long time to <hi>Avignon,</hi> not for their good behaviour. Next unto these Families, we may reckon up some, who owe all their Greatness to the good Fortune that they have had, to have some Popes of their Families; which are the Dukes <hi>Bonelli,</hi> who have been advanc't by <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> their Uncle.</p>

                     <p>All these Families live upon the Revenue of their Lands, and Lordships, and of the Rents of Pallaces, Houses, and of Vineyards, which they have in <hi>Rome,</hi> and about it, and on the Rents assign'd on the Mounts of the <hi>Pieta, San Spirito,</hi> and others. Also upon Offices, which are erected for the payment of Debts contracted by the Pope, or Dominion of the Ecclesiastical See, whereof the Rent is paid at so much <hi>per cent;</hi> according unto the conditions which have been made thereupon.</p>
                     <p>When the Pope hath need of money, for any ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasion; after having made the Consistory of Cardinals acquainted with it; he gives out a Brief, by the which he gives order to the Treasurer General of the State, to publish; That whosoever will give or lend Money to the Chamber, he shall receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, foure, five, or six <hi>per cent,</hi> according to the quality of the time; And for security of the said pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he assignes a certain piece of Land, which he ingages particularly and generally upon those Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. That debt is called <hi>Monte;</hi> assuming a name
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48485:87"/> from the cause of its erection, or from the Erector; as <hi>Monte della Fede, Monte di Ferrara, Monte Pio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And least debts should lye confus'd. The Mounts are devided in Place or Portions, that each is worth an hundred crowns; and for each Place, is given a Patent or Obligation: insomuch; that a person that shall have disbursed a thousand crowns, shall have ten Patents, which he may make sale of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a part if he think good; forasmuch as the Prince never payes back the Principal, but payes pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the interest of it, as long as the Mount stands.</p>
                     <p>And the difficulty of placing safely ones money, hath occasioned that one of those Mounts, whereof the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are worth an hundred crowns, hath been re-sould even for an hundred and ten, an hundred and twelve, and an hundred and fifteen. But many have nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deceived themselves; for the Prince, having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to suppresse one of those Mounts, causeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be given to the Creditors to come and receive their re-imbursment at such a Treasurers, restoring for each Patent, the summ therein contained.</p>
                     <p>When any Prince, or <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, hath a mind to errect one of these Mounts, he asketh permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Pope; representing unto him his occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; offers him the examining of the Stock which he intends to ingage: so that the Pope, finding the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse just and profitable, he becometh their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>And if these persons happen to fail in the payment of the said Interests; his Holiness, after having sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd them with all Formalities of Justice, he puts himself in possession of all the Estates which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and payes the said Rents in his Name, as it hath hapned unto the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> who had erected a Mount of a Million of Gold, which was assigned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48485:87"/> upon the Dukedomes of <hi>Castro</hi> and <hi>Roncilione</hi> neer <hi>Rome</hi> and having faild two or three years, one after another, to pay the Interest; The Pope seased himself of the Morgaged Dukedomes, which were soon demolished &amp; their Inheritance refunded to the Apostolick Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in case that the Duke should not pay the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the said Mount on the twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> 1657.</p>
                     <p>The which not having been performed; the Duke hath been deprived of the Government of the said Dukedomes, which are incorporated a new into the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>The difference betwixt the Mounts which are the Popes, and those which belong to particular Men is; that the Popes are call'd <hi>Camerali,</hi> and the others <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
